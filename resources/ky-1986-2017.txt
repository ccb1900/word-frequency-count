   Text 1 
   First two hours, now three hours ― this is how far in advance 
authorities are recommending people 
   show up to catch a domestic flight, at least at some major U.S. 
airports with increasingly massive security lines. 
   Americans are willing to tolerate time-consuming security protocols 
in return for increased safety. The crash of Egypt Air Flight 804, which 
terrorists may have downed over the Mediterranean Sea, provides another 
tragic reminder of why. But demanding too much of air travelers or 
providing too little security in return undermines public support for 
the process. And it should: Wasted time is a drag on Americans' economic 
and private lives, not to mention infuriating. 
   Last year, the Transportation Security Administration(TSA) found in 
a secret check that undercover investigators were able to sneak weapons 
― both fake and real ― past airport security nearly every time 
   they tried. Enhanced security measures since then, combined with a 
rise in airline travel due to the improving economy and low oil prices, 
have resulted in long waits at major airports such as Chicago's O'Hare 
International. It is not yet clear how much more effective airline 
security has become ― but the 
   lines are obvious. 
   Part of the issue is that the government did not anticipate the 
steep increase in airline travel, so the TSA is now rushing to get new 
screeners on the line. Part of the issue is that airports have only so 
much room for screening lanes. Another factor may be that more people 
are trying to overpack their carry-on bags to avoid checked-baggage fees, 
though the airlines strongly dispute this. 
   There is one step the TSA could take that would not require 
remodeling airports or rushing to hire: Enroll more people in the 
PreCheck program. PreCheck is supposed to be a win-win for travelers and 
the TSA. Passengers who pass a background check are eligible to use 
expedited screening lanes. This allows the TSA to focus on travelers who 
are higher risk, saving time for everyone involved. TSA wants to enroll 
25 million people in PreCheck. 
   It has not gotten anywhere close to that, and one big reason is 
sticker shock: Passengers must pay $85 every five years to process their 
background checks. Since the beginning, this price tag has been 
PreCheck's fatal flaw. Upcoming reforms might bring the price to a more 
reasonable level. But Congress should look into doing so directly, by 
helping to finance PreCheck enrollment or to cut costs in other 
   - 2 - 
   ways. 
   The TSA cannot continue diverting resources into underused PreCheck 
lanes while most of the traveling public suffers in unnecessary lines. 
It is long past time to make the program work. 
   21. The crash of Egypt Air Flight 804 is mentioned to____ 
   [A] explain American‘s tolerance of current security checks. 
   [B] stress the urgency to strengthen security worldwide. 
   [C] highlight the necessity of upgrading major U.S. airports. 
   [D] emphasize the importance of privacy protection. 
   22. Which of the following contributes to long waits at major 
airports? 
   [A] New restrictions on carry-on bags. 
   [B] The declining efficiency of the TSA. 
   [C] An increase in the number of travellers. 
   [D] Frequent unexpected secret checks. 
   23. The word Dexpedited‖ (Liner 4, Para. 5) is closet in meaning 
to____ 
   [A] quieter. 
   [B] cheaper. 
   [C] wider. 
   [D] faster. 
   24. One problem with the PreCheck program is____ 
   [A] a dramatic reduction of its scale. 
   [B] its wrongly-directed implementation. 
   [C] the government‘s reluctance to back it. 
   [D] an unreasonable price for enrollment. 
   25. Which of the following would be the best for the text? 
   [A] Less Screening for More Safety 
   [B] PreCheck C a Belated Solution 
   [C] Getting Stuck in Security Lines

   DThe ancient Hawaiians were astronomers,‖ wrote Queen Liliuokalani, 
Hawaii's last reigning 
   monarch, in 1897. Star watchers were among the most esteemed members 
of Hawaiian society. Sadly, all is not well with astronomy in Hawaii 
today. Protests have erupted over construction of the Thirty Meter 
Telescope (TMT), a giant observatory that promises to revolutionize 
humanity's view of the cosmos. 
   At issue is the TMT's planned location on Mauna Kea, a dormant 
volcano worshiped by some Hawaiians as the piko, that connects the 
Hawaiian Islands to the heavens. But Mauna Kea is also home to some of 
the world's most powerful telescopes. Rested in the Pacific Ocean, Mauna 
Kea's peak rises above the bulk of our planet's dense atmosphere, where 
conditions allow telescopes to obtain images of unsurpassed clarity. 
   Opposition to telescopes on Mauna Kea is nothing new. A small but 
vocal group of Hawaiians and 
   - 3 - 
   environmentalists have long viewed their presence as disrespect far 
sacred land and a painful reminder of the occupation of what was once a 
sovereign nation. 
   Some blame for the current controversy belongs to astronomers. In 
their eagerness to build bigger telescopes, they forgot that science is 
not the only way of understanding the world. They did not always 
prioritize the protection of Mauna Kea's fragile ecosystems or its 
holiness to the islands' inhabitants. Hawaiian culture is not a relic of 
the past; it is a living culture undergoing a renaissance today. 
   Yet science has a cultural history, too, with roots going back to 
the dawn of civilization. The same curiosity to find what lies beyond 
the horizon that first brought early Polynesians to Hawaii's shores 
inspires astronomers today to explore the heavens. Calls to disassemble 
all telescopes on Mauna Kea or to ban future development there ignore 
the reality that astronomy and Hawaiian culture both seek to answer big 
questions about who we are, where we come from and where we are going. 
Perhaps that is why we explore the starry skies, as if answering a 
primal calling to know ourselves and our true ancestral homes. 
   The astronomy community is making compromises to change its use of 
Mauna Kea. The TMT site was chosen to minimize the telescope‘s 
visibility around the island and to avoid archaeological and 
environmental impact. To limit the number of telescopes on Mauna Kea, 
old ones will be removed at the end of their lifetimes and their sites 
returned to a natural state. There is no reason why everyone cannot be 
welcomed on Mauna Kea to embrace their cultural heritage and to study 
the stars. 
   26. Queen Liliuokalani‘s remark in Paragraph 1 indicates____ 
   [A] her conservative view on the historical role of astronomy. 
   [B] the importance of astronomy in ancient Hawaiian society. 
   [C]the regrettable decline of astronomy in ancient times. 
   [D] her appreciation of star watchers‘ feats in her time. 
   27. Mauna Kea is deemed as an ideal astronomical site due to____ 
   [A] its geographical features. 
   [B] its protective surroundings. 
   [C] its religious implications. 
   [D] its existing infrastructure. 
   28. The construction of the TMT is opposed by some locals partly 
because____ 
   [A] it may risk ruining their intellectual life. 
   [B] it reminds them of a humiliating history. 
   [C] their culture will lose a chance of revival. 
   [D] they fear losing control of Mauna Kea. 
   29. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that progress in today‘s 
astronomy____ 
   [A] is fulfilling the dreams of ancient Hawaiians. 
   [B] helps spread Hawaiian culture across the world. 
   [C] may uncover the origin of Hawaiian culture. 
   [D] will eventually soften Hawaiians‘ hostility. 
   30. The author‘s attitude toward choosing Mauna Kea as the TMT site 
is one of____ 
   - 4 - 
   [A] severe criticism. 
   [B] passive acceptance. 
   [C] slight hesitancy. 
   [D] full approval.

   Robert F. Kennedy once said that a country‘s GDP 
measures Deverything except that which makes life worthwhile.‖ With 
Britain voting to leave the European Union, and GDP already predicted to 
slow as a result, it is now a timely moment to assess what he was 
referring to. 
   The question of GDP and its usefulness has annoyed policymakers for 
over half a century. Many argue that it is a flawed concept. It measures 
things that do not matter and miss things that do. By most recent 
measures, the UK‘s GDP has been the envy of the Western World, with 
record low unemployment 
   and high growth figures. If everything was going so so well, then 
why did over 17million people vote for Brexit, despite the warnings 
about what it could do to their country‘s economic prospects? 
   A recent annual study of countries and their ability to convert 
growth into well-being sheds some light on that question. Across the 163 
countries measured, the UK is one of the poorest performers in ensuring 
that economic growth is translated into meaningful improvement for its 
citizens. Rather than just focusing on GDR over 40 different sets of 
criteria from health, education and civil society engagement have been 
measured to get a more rounded assessment of how countries are 
performing. 
   While all of these countries face their own challenges, there are a 
number of consistent themes. Yes, there has been a budding economic 
recovery since the 2008 global crash, but in key indicators in areas 
such as health and education, major economies have continued to decline. 
Yet this isn't the case with all countries. Some relatively poor 
European countries have seen huge improvements across measures including 
civil society; income equality and the environment. 
   This is a lesson that rich countries can learn: When GDP is no 
longer regarded as the sole measure of a country‘s success, the world 
looks very different. 
   So what Kennedy was referring to was that while GDP has been the 
most common method for measuring the economic activity of nations, as a 
measure, it is no longer enough. It does not include important factors 
such as environmental equality or education outcomes - all things that 
contribute to a person's sense of well-being. 
   The sharp hit to growth predicted around the world and in the UK 
could lead to a decline in the everyday services we depend on for our 
well-being and for growth. But policymaker who refocus efforts on 
improving well-being rather than simply worrying about GDP figures could 
avoid the forecasted doom and may even see progress. 
   31. Robert F. Kennedy is cited because he_____ 
   [A]praised the UK for its GDP. 
   [B]identified GDP with happiness. 
   [C]misinterpreted the role of GDP. 
   [D]had a low opinion of GDP. 
   32. It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that____ 
   [A]the UK is reluctant to remold its economic pattern. 
   [B]the UK will contribute less to the world economy. 
   [C]GDP as the measure of success is widely defied in the UK. 
   [D]policymakers in the UK are paying less attention to GDP.

   33. Which of the following is true about the recent annual study? 
   [A]It excludes GDP as an indicator. 
   [B]It is sponsored by 163 countries. 
   [C]Its criteria are questionable. 
   [D]Its results are enlightening. 
   34. In the last two paragraphs, the author suggests that____ 
   [A]the UK is preparing for an economic boom. 
   [B]high GDP foreshadows an economic decline. 
   [C]it is essential to consider factors beyond GDP. 
   [D]it requires caution to handle economic issues. 
   35. Which of the following is the best??for the text?

   In a rare unanimous ruling, the US Supreme Court has overturned the 
corruption conviction of a former Virginia governor, Robert McDonnell. 
But it did so while holding its nose at the ethics of his conduct, which 
included accepting gifts such as a Rolex watch and a Ferrari Automobile 
from a company seeking access to government. 
   The high court‘s decision said the judge in Mr. McDonnell‘s trail 
failed to tell a jury that it must look only at his Dofficial acts,‖ 
or the former governor‘s decisions on Dspecific‖ and Dunsettled‖ 
issues related to his duties. 
   Merely helping a gift-giver gain access to other officials, unless 
done with clear intent to pressure those officials, is not corruption, 
the justices found. 
   The court did suggest that accepting favors in return for opening 
doors is Ddistasteful‖ and Dnasty.‖ But under anti-bribery laws, 
proof must be made of concrete benefits, such as approval of a contract 
or regulation. Simply arranging a meeting, making a phone call, or 
hosting an event is not an Dofficial act.‖ 
   The court‘s ruling is legally sound in defining a kind of 
favoritism that is not criminal. Elected 
   leaders must be allowed to help supporters deal with bureaucratic 
problems without fear of prosecution of bribery. DThe basic compact 
underlying representative government,‖ wrote Chief Justice John Roberts 
for the court, Dassumes that public officials will hear from their 
constituents and act on their concerns.‖ 
   But the ruling reinforces the need for citizens and their elected 
representatives, not the courts, to ensure equality of access to 
government. Officials must not be allowed to play favorites in providing 
information or in arranging meetings simply because an individual or 
group provides a campaign donation or a personal gift. This type of 
integrity requires will-enforced laws in government transparency, such 
as records of official meetings, rules on lobbying, and information 
about each elected leader‘s source 
   of wealth. 
   Favoritism in official access can fan public perceptions of 
corruption. But it is not always corruption. Rather officials must avoid 
double standards, or different types of access for average people and 
the wealthy. If connections can be bought, a basic premise of democratic 
society C that all are equal in 
   - 6 - 
   treatment by government- is undermined. Good government rests on an 
understanding of the inherent worth of each individual. 
   The court‘s ruling is a step forward in the struggle against both 
corruption and official favoritism. 
   36. The underlined sentence(Para.1) most probably shows that the 
court____ 
   [A] avoided defining the extent of McDonnell‘s duties. 
   [B] made no compromise in convicting McDonnell. 
   [C] was contemptuous of McDonnell‘s conduct. 
   [D] refused to comment on McDonnell‘s ethics. 
   37. According to Paragraph 4, an official act is deemed corruptive 
only if it involves____ 
   [A] concrete returns for gift-givers. 
   [B] sizable gains in the form of gifts. 
   [C] leaking secrets intentionally. 
   [D] breaking contracts officially. 
   38. The court‘s ruling is d on the assumption that public officials 
are__ 
   [A] allowed to focus on the concerns of their supporters. 
   [B] qualified to deal independently with bureaucratic issues. 
   [C] justified in addressing the needs of their constituents. 
   [D] exempt from conviction on the charge of favoritism. 
   39. Well-enforced laws in government transparency are needed to___ 
   [A] awaken the conscience of officials. 
   [B] guarantee fair play in official access. 
   [C] allow for certain kinds of lobbying. 
   [D] inspire hopes in average people. 
   40. The author‘s attitude toward the court‘s ruling is____ 
   [A] sarcastic. 
   [B] tolerant. 
   [C] skeptical. 
   [D] supportive.

   [A]The first published sketch, "A Dinner at Poplar Walk" brought 
tears to Dickens's eyes when he discovered it in the pages of The 
Monthly Magazine. From then on his sketches ,which appeared under the 
pen name "Boz" in The Evening Chronicle, earned him a modest reputation. 
   [B]The runaway success of The Pickwick Papers, as it is generally 
known today, secured Dickens's fame. There were Pickwick coats and 
Pickwick cigars, and the plump, spectacled hero, Samuel Pickwick, became 
a national figure. 
   - 7 - 
   [C]Soon after Sketches by Boz appeared, a publishing firm approached 
Dickens to write a story in monthly installments, as a backdrop for a 
series of woodcuts by the ten-famous artist Robert Seymour, who had 
originated the idea for the story. With characteristic confidence, 
Dickens successfully insisted that Seymour's pictures illustrate his own 
story instead. After the first installment, Dickens wrote to the artist 
and asked him to correct a drawing Dickens felt was not faithful enough 
to his prose. Seymour made the change, went into his backyard, and 
expressed his displeasure by committing suicide. Dickens and his 
publishers simply pressed on with a new artist. The comic novel, The 
Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, appeared serially in 1836 and 
1837, and was first published in book form in 1837. 
   [D]Charles Dickens is probably the best-known and, to many people, 
the greatest English novelist of the 19th century. A moralist, satirist, 
and social reformer. Dickens crafted complex plots and striking 
characters that capture the panorama of English society. 
   [E]Soon after his father's release from prison, Dickens got a better 
job as errand boy in law offices. He taught himself shorthand to get an 
even better job later as a court stenographer and as a reporter in 
Parliament. At the same time, Dickens, who had a reporter's eye for 
transcribing the life around him especially anything comic or odd, 
submitted short sketches to obscure magazines. 
   [F] Dickens was born in Portsmouth, on England's southern coast. His 
father was a clerk in the British navy pay office -a respectable 
position, but wish little social status. His paternal grandparents, a 
steward and a housekeeper possessed even less status, having been 
servants, and Dickens later concealed their background. Dicken's mother 
supposedly came from a more respectable family. Yet two years before 
Dicken's birth, his mother's father was caught stealing and fled to 
Europe, never to return. The family's increasing poverty forced Dickens 
out of school at age 12 to work in Warren's Blacking Warehouse, a shoe-
polish factory, where the other working boys mocked him as "the young 
gentleman." His father was then imprisoned for debt. The humiliations of 
his father's imprisonment and his labor in the blacking factory formed 
Dicken's greatest wound and became his deepest secret. He could not 
confide them even to his wife, although they provide the unacknowledged 
foundation of his fiction. 
   [G] After Pickwick, Dickens plunged into a bleaker world. In Oliver 
Twist, e traces an orphan's progress from the workhouse to the criminal 
slums of London. Nicholas Nickleby, his next novel, combines the 
darkness of Oliver Twist with the sunlight of Pickwick. The popularity 
of these novels consolidated Dichens' as a nationally and 
internationally celebrated man of letters.

   The growth of the use of English as the world`s primary language for 
international communication has obviously been continuing for several 
decades. 
   (46)But even as the number of English speakers expands further there 
are signs that the global predominance of the language may fade within 
the foreseeable future. 
   Complex international, economic, technological and culture change 
could start to diminish the leading position of English as the language 
of the world market, and UK interests which enjoy advantage from the 
breath of English usage would consequently face new pressures. Those 
realistic possibilities are highlighted in the study presented by David 
Graddol 
   (47)His analysis should therefore end any self-contentedness among 
those who may believe that the global position of English is so stable 
that the young generation of the United Kingdom do not need 
   - 8 - 
   additional language capabilities. 
   David Graddol concludes that monoglot English graduates face a bleak 
economic future as qualified multilingual youngsters from other 
countries are proving to have a competitive advantage over their British 
counterparts in global companies and organizations. Alongside 
that,(48)many countries are introducing English into the primary-school 
curriculum but British schoolchildren and students do not appear to be 
gaining greater encouragement to achieve fluency in other languages. 
   If left to themselves, such trends will diminish the relative 
strength of the English language in international education markets as 
the demand for educational resources in languages, such as 
Spanish ,Arabic or Mandarin grows and international business process 
outsourcing in other language such as Japanese, French and German, 
spreads. 
   (49)The changes identified by David Graddol all present clear and 
major challenges to UK`s providers of English language teaching to 
people of other countries and to broader education business sectors. The 
English language teaching sector directly earns nearly &1.3 billion for 
the UK in invisible exports and our other education related explores 
earn up to &10 billion a year more. As the international education 
market expands, the recent slowdown in the number of international 
students studying in the main English-speaking countries is likely to 
continue, especially if there are no effective strategic policies to 
prevent such slippage. 
   The anticipation of possible shifts in demand provided by this study 
is significant:(50) It gives a basis to all organization which seek to 
promote the learning and use of English,a basis for planning to meet the 
possibilities of what could be a very different operating 
environment.That is a necessary and practical approach. In this as in 
much else, those who wish to influence the future must prepare for it.

   Text 1 
   France, which prides itself as the global innovator of fashion, has 
decided its fashion industry has lost an absolute right to define 
physical beauty for women. Its lawmakers gave preliminary approval last 
week to a law that would make it a crime to employ ultra-thin models on 
runaways. The parliament also agreed to ban websites that Dincite 
excessive thinness‖ by promoting extreme dieting. 
   Such measures have a couple of uplifting motives. They suggest 
beauty should not be defined by looks that end up impinging on health. 
That‘s a start. And the ban on ultra-thin models seems to go beyond 
protecting models from starving themselves to death-as some have done. 
It tells the fashion industry that it must take responsibility for the 
signal it sends women, especially teenage girls, about the social tape-
measure they must use to determine their individual worth. 
   The bans, if fully enforced,would suggest to women (and many men) 
that they should not let others be arbiters of their beauty. And perhaps 
faintly,they hint that people should look to intangible qualities like 
character and intellect rather than dieting their way to size zero or 
wasp-waist physiques. 
   The French measures, however, rely too much on severe punishment to 
change a culture that still regards beauty as skin-deep-and bone-showing. 
Under the law, using a fashion model that does not meet a government-
defined index of body mass could result in a $85,000 fine and six months 
in prison. 
   - 12 - 
   The fashion industry knows it has an inherent problem in focusing on 
material adornment and idealized body types. In Denmark, the United 
States, and a few other countries, it is trying to set voluntary 
standards for models and fashion images that rely more on peer pressure 
for enforcement. 
   In contrast to France‘s actions, Denmark‘s fashion industry agreed 
last month on rules and sanctions regar
   ding the age, health, and other characteristics of models. The newly 
revised Danish Fashion Ethical Charter clearly states: DWe are aware of 
and take responsibility for the impact the fashion industry has on body 
ideals, especially on young people.‖ The charter‘s main tool of 
enforcement is to deny access for designers and modeling agencies to 
Copenhagen Fashion Week (CFW), which is run by the Danish Fashion 
Institute. But in general it relies on a name-and-shame method of 
compliance. 
   Relying on ethical persuasion rather than law to address the misuse 
of body ideals may be the best step. Even better would be to help 
elevate notions of beauty beyond the material standards of a particular 
industry. 21. According to the first paragraph, what would happen in 
France? 
   [A]New runways would be constructed. 
   [B]Physical beauty would be redefined. 
   [C]Websites about dieting would thrive. 
   [D]The fashion industry would decline. 
   22. The phrase Dimpinging on‖ (Line2, Para.2) is closest in 
meaning to . 
   [A]heightening the value of. 
   [B]indicating the state of. 
   [C]losing faith in. 
   [D]doing harm to. 
   23. Which of the following is true of the fashion industry? 
   [A]New standards are being set in Denmark. 
   [B]The French measures have already failed. 
   [C]Models are no longer under peer pressure. 
   [D]Its inherent problems are getting worse. 
   24. A designer is most likely to be rejected by CFW for . 
   [A]pursuing perfect physical conditions. 
   [B]caring too much about models‘ character. 
   [C]showing little concern for health factors.

   [A]A Challenge to the Fashion Industry‘s Body Ideals 
   [B]A Dilemma for the Starving Models in France

   For the first time in history more people live in towns than in the 
country. In Britain this has had a curious result. While polls show 
Britons rate Dthe countryside‖ alongside the royal family, Shakespeare 
and the Natio
   - 13 - 
   nal Health Service (NHS) as what makes them proudest of their 
country, this has limited political support. 
   A century ago Octavia Hill launched the National Trust not to rescue 
stylish houses but to save Dthe beau
   ty of natural places for everyone forever.‖ It was specifically to 
provide city dwellers with spaces for leisure w
   here they could experience Da refreshing air.‖ Hill‘s pressures 
later led to the creation of national parks and gre
   en belts. They don‘t make countryside any more, and every year 
concrete consumes more of it. It needs constant guardianship. 
   At the next election none of the big parties seem likely to endorse 
this sentiment. The Conservatives‘ plan
   ning reform explicitly gives rural development priority over 
conservation, even authorizingDoff-plan‖ building 
   where local people might object. The concept of sustainable 
development has been defined as profitable. Labour likewise wants to 
discontinue local planning where councils oppose development. The 
Liberal Democrats are silent. Only Ukip, sensing its chance, has sided 
with those pleading for a more considered approach to using green land. 
Its Campaign to Protect Rural England struck terror into many local 
Conservative parties. 
   The sensible place to build new houses, factories and offices is 
where people are, in cities and towns where infrastructure is in place. 
The London agents StirlingAckroyd recently identified enough sites for 
half a million houses in the London area alone, with no intrusion on 
green belt. What is true of London is even truer of the
   provinces. 
   The idea that Dhousing crisis‖ equals Dconcreted meadows‖ is 
pure lobby talk. The issue is not the need f
   or more houses but, as always, where to put them. Under lobby 
pressure, George Osborne favours rural new-build against urban 
renovation and renewal. He favours out-of-town shopping sites against 
high streets. This is not a free market but a biased one. Rural towns 
and villages have grown and will always grow. They do so best where 
building sticks to their edges and respects their character. We do not 
ruin urban conservation areas. Why
   ruin rural ones? 
   Development should be planned, not let rip. After the Netherlands, 
Britain is Europe‘s most crowded cou
   ntry. Half a century of town and country planning has enabled it to 
retain an enviable rural coherence, while still permitting low-density 
urban living. There is no doubt of the alternative―the corrupted 
landscapes of southe
   rn Portugal, Spain or Ireland. Avoiding this rather than promoting 
it should unite the left and right of the political spectrum. 
   26. Britain‘s public sentiment about the countryside . 
   [A]didn‘tstart till the Shakespearean age. 
   [B]has brought much benefit to the NHS. 
   [C]is fully backed by the royal family. 
   [D]is not well reflected in politics.

   27. According to Paragraph 2, the achievements of the National Trust 
are now being____ . [A]gradually destroyed. 
   [B]effectively reinforced. 
   [C]largely overshadowed. 
   [D]properly protected. 
   28. Which of the following can be inferred from Paragraph 3? 
   [A]Labour is under attack for opposing development. 
   [B]The Conservatives may abandon Doff-plan‖ building. 
   [C]The Liberal Democrats are losing political influence. 
   [D]Ukip may gain from its support for rural conservation. 
   29. The author holds that George Osborne‘s preference____ . 
   [A]highlights his firm stand against lobby pressure. 
   [B]shows his disregard for the character of rural areas. 
   [C]stresses the necessity of easing the housing crisis. 
   [D]reveals a strong prejudice against urban areas. 
   30. In the last paragraph, the author shows his appreciation of____ . 
   [A]the size of population in Britain. 
   [B]the political life in today‘s Britain. 
   [C]the enviable urban lifestyle in Britain. 
   [D]the town-and-country planning in Britain.

   DThere is one and only one social responsibility of business,‖ 
wrote Milton Friedman,a Nobel prize-winning ec
   onomist DThat is, to use its resources and engage in activities 
designed to increase its profits.‖ But even if you 
   accept Fiedman‘s premise and regard corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) policies as a waste of shareholders money,things may not be 
absolutely clear-cut.New research suggests that CSR may create monetary 
value for companies Cat least when they are prosecuted for corruption. 
   The largest firms is America and Britain together spend more than 
$15 billion a year on CSR , according to an estimate by EPG,a consulting 
firm ,This could add value to their businesses in three ways.First, 
consumers
   may take CSR spending as a Dsignal‖ that a company‘s products are 
of high quality.Second, customers may be
   willing to buy a company‘s products as an indirect way to donate to 
the good causes is helps. And third, through a more diffuse Dhalo 
effect,‖ whereby its good deeds earn it greater consideration from 
consumers and others. 
   Previous studies on CSR have had trouble differentiating these 
effects because consumers can be affected by all three. A recent study 
attempts to separate them by looking at bribery prosecutions under 
America‘s Forei
   gn Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). It argues that since prosecutors do 
not consume a company's products as part
   of their investigations, they could be influenced only by the halo 
effect. 
   The study found that, among prosecuted firms, those with the most 
comprehensiveCSR programmes tend
   - 15 - 
   edto getmore lenient penalties. Their analysis ruled out the 
possibility that it was firms' political influence, rather than their 
CSR stand,that accounted for the leniency: Companies that contributed 
more to political campaigns did not receive lower fines. 
   In all, the study concludes that whereas prosecutors should only 
evaluate a case based on its merits, they do seen to influenced by a 
company‘s record in CSR. "We estimate that either eliminating a 
substantial labour-rights concern, such as child labour, or increasing 
corporate giving by about 20% results in fines that generally are 40% 
lower than the typical punishment for bribing foreign officials," says 
one researcher. 
   Researchers admit that their study does not answer the question of 
how much businesses ought to spend on CSR. Nor does it reveal how much 
companies are banking on the halo effect, rather than the other possible 
benefits, when they decide their do-gooding policies. But at least have 
demonstrated that whencompanies get into trouble with the law, evidence 
of good character can win

   There will eventually come a day when The New York Times cases to 
publish stories on newsprint .Exactly when that day will be is a matter 
of debate. DSometime in the future Dthe paper‘s publisher said back 
in 2
   010. 
   Nostalgia for ink on paper and the rustle of pages aside ,there‘s 
plenty of incentive to ditch print .The i
   nfrastructure required to make a physical newspapers -printing 
presses .delivery truck -isn‘t just expensive it‘s 
   excessive at a time when online-only competition don‘t have the 
same set financial constraints . Readers are mi
   grating away from print away,And although print ad sales still dwarf 
their online and mobile counterparts revenue from print is still 
declining. 
   Overhead may be high and circulation lowe ,but rushing to eliminate 
its print editor would be a mistake ,says BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti. 
   Peretti says the Times shouldn't waste time getting of the print 
business, only if they go about doing it the right away DFiguring out a 
way to accelerate that transition would make sense for them Dhe 
said, Dbut if you 
   discontinue it, you're going to have your most loyal customers 
really upset with you." Sometimes that's worth making a change anyway". 
Peretti gives example of Netflix discontinuing its DVD-mailing service 
to focus on streaming. "It was seen as a blunder." he said. The move 
turned out to be foresighted. And if Peretti were in charge at the times? 
"l wouldn't pick year to end print."he said. DI would raise and make it 
into more of a legacy p
   roduct.‖ 
   The most loyal costumer would still gel the product they favor. the 
idea goes, and they‘d feel like they we
   re helping sustain the quality of something they believe in. "So if 
you're overpaying for print, you could feel like you were helping," 
peretti said. "Then increase it at rate each year and essentially try to 
generate additional revenue." In other words, if you're going to print 
product, make it for the people who are already obsessed with
   it. Which may be what the Times is doing already. Getting the print 
edition seven days a week costs nearly $500 a year ― more than twice as 
much as a digital-only subscription. 
   "It's a really hard thing to do and it's a tremendous luxury that 
BuzzFeed doesn't have a legacy business," 
   - 17 - 
   Peretti remarked. "But we're going to have questions like that where 
we have things we're doing that don't mak
   e sense when the market.Change and the world changes. In those 
situations, it's better to be more aggressive th
   an less aggressive."

should .

   So how do we navigate this?How do we know when to invest in 
anupgrade?And what‘s the best way to 
   pull off one that enhances our goals,Here are some tips: 
   41. 
   As an executive coach, I‘ve seen image upgrades be 
particularlyhelpfulduring transitions―when loo
   king for a new job , stepping into a new or morepublic role ,or 
changing work environments. If you‘re in
   a period of change or just feeling stuck and in a rut, now may be a 
good time. If you‘re not sure, ask forhonest
   feedback from trusted friends, colleagues and professionals .Look 
for cues 
   about how others perceive you. Maybe there‘s no need for an upgrade 
and that‘s OK. 
   42. 
   Get clear on what impact you‘re hoping to have. Are you looking to 
refresh your image or pivot it? For one person, the goal may be to be 
taken more seriously and enhance their professional image. For another, 
it may be to be perceived as more 
   approachable, or more modern and stylish. For someone moving from 
finance to advertising, maybe they want to look ore DSoHo.‖ (It‘s OK 
to use characterizations like that.) 
   43. 
   Look at your work environment like an anthropologist. What are the 
norms of your environment? What c
   - 19 - 
   onveys status? Who are your most important audience? How do the 
people you respect and look up to prevent themselves? The better you 
understand the cultural context, the more control you can have over your 
impact. 
   44. 
   Enlist the support of professionals and share with them your goals 
and context. Hire a personal stylist, or use the free styling service of 
a store like Crew. Try a hair stylist instead of a barber. Work with a 
professional photographer instead of your spouse of friend. It‘s not as 
expensive as you might think. 
   45. 
   The point of a style upgrade isn‘t to become more vain or to spend 
more time discussing over what to wea
   r. Instead, use it as an opportunity to reduce decision fatigue. 
Pick a standard work uniform or a few go-to opinions. Buy all your 
clothes once with a stylist instead of shopping alone, one article of 
clothing a time.

   Mental health is our birthright. (46) We don‘t have to learn how to 
be mentally healthy; it is built into us i
   n the same way that our bodies know how to heal a cut or mend a 
broken bone. Mental health can't be learned, 
   only reawakened. It is like the immune system of the body, which 
under stress or through lack of nutrition or exercise can be weakened, 
but which never leaves us. When we don't understand the value of mental 
health and we don't know how to gain access to it, mental health will 
remain hidden from us. (47) Our mental health doesn‘t really go 
anywhere; like the sun behind a cloud. it can be temporarily hidden from 
view, but it is fully capable of being restored in an instant. 
   Mental health is the seed that contains self-esteem ― confidence in 
ourselves and an ability to trust in our
   common sense. It allows us to have perspective on our lives ― the 
ability to not take ourselves too seriously, t
   o laugh at ourselves, to see the bigger picture, and to see that 
things will work out. It's a form of innate or unlearned optimism. (48) 
Mental health allows us to view others with sympathy if they are having 
troubles with kindness if they are in pain and with unconditional love 
no matter who they are. Mental health is the source of cre
   ativity for solving problems, resolving conflict, making our 
surroundings more beautiful, managing our home

   life, or coming up with a creative business idea or invention to 
make our lives easier. It gives us patience for ourselves and toward 
others as well as patience while driving, catching a fish, working on 
our car. or raising a child. It allows us to see the beauty that 
surrounds us each moment in nature, in culture, in the flow of our daily 
lives. 
   (49)Although mental health is the cure-all for living our lives, it 
is perfectly ordinary as you will see that it has been there to direct 
you through all your difficult decisions. It has been available even in 
the most munda
   ne of life situations to show you right from wrong, good from bad, 
friend from foe. Mental health has commonly been called conscience, 
instinct, wisdom, common sense, or the inner voice. We think of it 
simply as a healthy and helpful flow of intelligent thought. (50) As you 
will come to see, knowing that mental health is always available and 
knowing to trust it allow us to slow down to the moment and live life 
happily.

   King Juan Carlos of Spain once insisted Dkings don‘t abdicate, 
they dare in their sleep.‖ But embarrassing scandals and the popularity 
of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections have forced him to 
eat his words and stand down. So, does the Spanish crisis suggest that 
monarchy is seeing its last days? Does that mean the writing is on the 
wall for all European royals, with their magnificent uniforms and 
majestic lifestyle? 
   The Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy. 
When public opinion is particularly polarised, as it was following the 
end of the Franco regime, monarchs can rise above Dmere‖ politics 
and Dembody‖ a spirit of national unity. 
   It is this apparent transcendence of politics that explains 
monarchs‘ continuing popularity polarized. And 
   - 23 - 
   also, the Middle East excepted, Europe is the most monarch-infested 
region in the world, with 10 kingdoms (not counting Vatican City and 
Andorra). But unlike their absolutist counterparts in the Gulf and Asia, 
most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the 
difficult search for a non-controversial but respected public figure. 
   Even so, kings and queens undoubtedly have a downside. Symbolic of 
national unity as they claim to be, their very history―and sometimes 
the way they behave today C embodies outdated and indefensible 
privileges 
   and inequalities. At a time when Thomas Piketty and other economists 
are warning of rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited 
wealth, it is bizarre that wealthy aristocratic families should still be 
the symbolic heart of modern democratic states. 
   The most successful monarchies strive to abandon or hide their old 
aristocratic ways. Princes and princesses have day-jobs and ride 
bicycles, not horses (or helicopters). Even so, these are wealthy 
families who party with the international 1%, and media intrusiveness 
makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the right image. 
   While Europe‘s monarchies will no doubt be smart enough to survive 
for some time to come, it is the British royals who have most to fear 
from the Spanish example. 
   It is only the Queen who has preserved the monarchy‘s reputation 
with her rather ordinary (if well-heeled) 
   granny style. The danger will come with Charles, who has both an 
expensive taste of lifestyle and a pretty hierarchical view of the world. 
He has failed to understand that monarchies have largely survived 
because they provide a service C as non-controversial and non-political 
heads of state. Charles ought to know that as English history shows, it 
is kings, not republicans, who are the monarchy‘s worst enemies. 
   21. According to the first two Paragraphs, King Juan Carlos of Spain 
   [A] used turn enjoy high public support 
   [B] was unpopular among European royals 
   [C] cased his relationship with his rivals 
   [D]ended his reign in embarrassment 
   22. Monarchs are kept as heads of state in Europe mostly 
   [A] owing to their undoubted and respectable status 
   [B] to achieve a balance between tradition and reality 
   [C] to give voter more public figures to look up to 
   [D]due to their everlasting political embodiment

   Just how much does the Constitution protect your digital data? The 
Supreme Court will now consider whether police can search the contents 
of a mobile phone without a warrant if the phone is on or around a 
person during an arrest. 
   California has asked the justices to refrain from a sweeping ruling 
particularly one that upsets the old assumption that authorities may 
search through the possessions of suspects at the time of their arrest. 
It is hard, the state argues, for judges to assess the implications of 
new and rapidly changing technologies. 
   The court would be recklessly modest if it followed California‘s 
advice. Enough of the implications are discernable, even obvious, so 
that the justices can and should provide updated guidelines to police, 
lawyers and defendants. 
   They should start by discarding California‘s lame argument that 
exploring the contents of a smart phone ― a vast storehouse of digital 
information ― is similar to, say, rifling through a suspect‘s purse. 
The court has 
   ruled that police don‘t violate the Fourth Amendment when they sift 
through the wallet or pocketbook of an arrestee without a warrant. But 
exploring one‘s smart phone is more like entering his or her home. A 
smart 
   - 25 - 
   phone may contain an arrestee‘s reading history, financial history, 
medical history and comprehensive records of recent correspondence. The 
development of Dcloud computing,‖ meanwhile, has made that exploration 
so much the easier. 
   Americans should take steps to protect their digital privacy. But 
keeping sensitive information on these devices is increasingly a 
requirement of normal life. Citizens still have a right to expect 
private documents to remain private and protected by the Constitution‘s 
prohibition on unreasonable searches. 
   As so often is the case, stating that principle doesn‘t ease the 
challenge of line-drawing. In many cases, it 
   would not be overly onerous for authorities to obtain a warrant to 
search through phone contents. They could still invalidate Fourth 
Amendment protections when facing severe, urgent circumstances, and they 
could take reasonable measures to ensure that phone data are not erased 
or altered while a warrant is pending. The court, though, may want to 
allow room for police to cite situations where they are entitled to more 
freedom. 
   But the justices should not swallow California‘s argument whole. 
New, disruptive technology sometimes demands novel applications of the 
Constitution‘s protections. Orin Kerr, a law professor, compares the 
explosion and accessibility of digital information in the 21st century 
with the establishment of automobile use as a virtual necessity of life 
in the 20th: The justices had to specify novel rules for the new 
personal domain of the passenger car then; they must sort out how the 
Fourth Amendment applies to digital information now. 
   26. The Supreme Court will work out whether, during an arrest, it is 
legitimate to 
   [A] prevent suspects from deleting their phone contents. 
   [B] search for suspects‘ mobile phones without a warrant. 
   [C] check suspects‘ phone contents without being authorized. 
   [D]prohibit suspects from using their mobile phones. 
   27. The author‘s attitude toward California‘s argument is one of 
   [A] disapproval. 
   [B] indifference. 
   [C] tolerance. 
   [D]cautiousness. 
   28. The author believes that exploring one‘s phone contents is 
comparable to 
   [A] getting into one‘s residence. 
   [B] handling one‘s historical records. 
   [C] scanning one‘s correspondences. 
   - 26 - 
   [D] going through one‘s wallet. 
   29. The author believes that exploring one‘s phone contents is 
comparable to 
   [A] principles are hard to be clearly expressed. 
   [B] the court is giving police less room for action. 
   [C] citizens‘ privacy is not effectively protected. 
   [D] phones are used to store sensitive information. 
   30. Orin Kerr‘s comparison is quoted to indicate that 
   [A] the Constitution should be implemented flexibly. 
   [B] new technology requires reinterpretation of the Constitution. 
   [C]California‘s argument violates principles of the Constitution. 
   [D]principles of the Constitution should never be altered

   The journal Science is adding an extra round of statistical checks 
to its peer-review process, editor-in-chief Marcia McNutt announced 
today. The policy follows similar efforts from other journals, after 
widespread concern that basic mistakes in data analysis are contributing 
to the irreproducibility of many published research findings. 
   DReaders must have confidence in the conclusions published in our 
journal,‖ writes McNutt in an editorial. Working with the American 
Statistical Association, the journal has appointed seven experts to a 
statistics board of reviewing editors(SBoRE). Manuscript will be flagged 
up for additional scrutiny by the journal‘s internal editors, or by its 
existing Board of Reviewing Editors or by outside peer reviewers. The 
SBoRE panel will then find external statisticians to review these 
manuscripts. 
   Asked whether any particular papers had impelled the change, McNutt 
said: DThe creation of the ?statistics board‘ was motivated by 
concerns broadly with the application of statistics and data analysis in 
scientific research and is part of?Science‘s overall drive to increase 
reproducibility in the research we publish.‖ 
   Giovanni Parmigiani, a biostatistician at the Harvard School of 
Public Health, a member of the SBoRE group. He says he expects the board 
to Dplay primarily an advisory role.‖ He agreed to join because 
he Dfound the foresight behind the establishment of the SBoRE to be 
novel, unique and likely to have a lasting impact. This impact will not 
only be through the publications in Science itself, but hopefully 
through a larger group of publishing places that may want to model their 
approach after Science.‖ 
   - 27 - 
   John Ioannidis, a physician who studies research methodology, says 
that the policy is Da most welcome step forward‖ and Dlong 
overdue.‖ DMost journals are weak in statistical review, and this 
damages the quality of what they publish. I think that, for the majority 
of scientific papers nowadays, statistical review is more essential than 
expert review,‖ he says. But he noted that biomedical journals such as 
Annals of Internal Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical 
Association and The Lancet pay strong attention to statistical review. 
   Professional scientists are expected to know how to analyze data, 
but statistical errors are alarmingly common in published research, 
according to David Vaux, a cell biologist. Researchers should improve 
their standards, he wrote in 2012, but journals should also take a 
tougher line, Dengaging reviewers who are 
   statistically literate and editors who can verify the process‖. 
Vaux says that Science‘s idea to pass some papers to 
statisticians Dhas some merit, but a weakness is that it relies on the 
board of reviewing editors to identify 
   ?the papers that need scrutiny‘ in the first place‖. 
   31. It can be learned from Paragraph 1 that 
   [A] Science intends to simplify their peer-review process. 
   [B] journals are strengthening their statistical checks. 
   [C] few journals are blamed for mistakes in data analysis. 
   [D] lack of data analysis is common in research projects. 
   32. The phrase Dflagged up‖ (Para. 2) is the closest in meaning to 
   [A] found. 
   [B] marked. 
   [C] revised. 
   [D] stored.

   [A] pose a threat to all its peers. 
   [B] meet with strong opposition. 
   [C] increase Science‘s circulation. 
   [D]set an example for other journals. 
   34. David Vaux holds that what Science is doing now 
   [A] adds to researchers‘ workload. 
   [B] diminishes the role of reviewers. 
   - 28 - 
   [C] has room for further improvement. 
   [D]is to fail in the foreseeable future 
   35. Which of the following is the best title of the text? 
   [A] Science Joins Push to Screen Statistics in Papers.

   Text 4 
   Two years ago, Rupert Murdoch‘s daughter ,Elisabeth ,spoke of 
the Dunsettling dearth of integrity across so many of our 
institutions‖ Integrity had collapsed, she argued, because of a 
collective acceptance that the 
   only Dsorting mechanism ‖in society should be profit and the 
market .But Dit‘s us ,human beings ,we the people who create the 
society we want ,not profit ‖. 
   Driving her point home, she continued: DIt‘s increasingly apparent 
that the absence of purpose, of a moral language within government, 
media or business could become one of the most dangerous foals for 
capitalism and freedom.‖ This same absence of moral purpose was 
wounding companies such as News 
   International ,shield thought ,making it more likely that it would 
lose its way as it had with widespread illegal telephone hacking . 
   As the hacking trial concludes C finding guilty ones-editor of the 
News of the World, Andy Coulson, for conspiring to hack phones ,and 
finding his predecessor, Rebekah Brooks, innocent of the same charge C
the 
   winder issue of dearth of integrity still standstill, Journalists 
are known to have hacked the phones of up to 5,500 people .This is 
hacking on an industrial scale ,as was acknowledged by Glenn Mulcaire, 
the man hired by the News of the World in 2001 to be the point person 
for phone hacking. Others await trial. This long story still unfolds. 
   In many respects, the dearth of moral purpose frames not only the 
fact of such widespread phone hacking but the terms on which the trial 
took place .One of the astonishing revelations was how little Rebekah 
Brooks knew of what went on in her newsroom, wow little she thought to 
ask and the fact that she never inquired wow the stories arrived. The 
core of her successful defence was that she knew nothing. 
   In today‘s world, title has become normal that well―paid 
executives should not be accountable for what 
   happens in the organizations that they run perhaps we should not be 
so surprised. For a generation, the 
   - 29 - 
   collective doctrine has been that the sorting mechanism of society 
should be profit. The words that have mattered are efficiency, 
flexibility, shareholder value, businessCfriendly, wealth generation, 
sales, impact and, in newspapers, circulation. Words degraded to the 
margin have been justice fairness, tolerance, proportionality 
   and accountability. 
   The purpose of editing the News of the World was not to promote 
reader understanding to be fair in what was written or to betray any 
common humanity. It was to ruin lives in the quest for circulation and 
impact. Ms 
   Brooks may or may not have had suspicions about how her journalists 
got their stories, but she asked no questions, gave no instructions―nor 
received traceable, recorded answers. 
   36. According to the first two paragraphs, Elisabeth was upset by 
   [A] the consequences of the current sorting mechanism 
   [B] companies‘ financial loss due to immoral practices. 
   [C] governmental ineffectiveness on moral issues. 
   [D]the wide misuse of integrity among institutions. 
   37. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that 
   [A] Glem Mulcaire may deny phone hacking as a crime 
   [B] more journalists may be found guilty of phone hacking. 
   [C] Andy Coulson should be held innocent of the charge. 
   [D] phone hacking will be accepted on certain occasions. 
   38. The author believes the Rebekah Books‘s deference 
   [A] revealed a cunning personality 
   [B] centered on trivial issues 
   [C] was hardly convincing 
   [D] was part of a conspiracy 
   39. The author holds that the current collective doctrine shows 
   [A] generally distorted values 
   [B] unfair wealth distribution 
   [C] a marginalized lifestyle 
   [D] a rigid moral cote 
   40. Which of the following is suggested in the last paragraph? 
   [A] The quality of writing is of primary importance. 
   - 30 - 
   [B] Common humanity is central news reporting. 
   [C] Moral awareness matters in exciting a newspaper. 
   [D] Journalists need stricter industrial regulations.

points) 
   How does your reading proceed? Clearly you try to comprehend, in the 
sense of identifying meanings for individual words and working out 
relationships between them, drawing on your explicit knowledge of 
English grammar (41) ______you begin to infer a context for the text, 
for instance, by making decisions about what kind of speech event is 
involved: who is making the utterance, to whom, when and where. 
   The ways of reading indicated here are without doubt kinds of of 
comprehension. But they show comprehension to consist not just passive 
assimilation but of active engagement inference and problem-solving. You 
infer information you feel the writer has invited you to grasp by 
presenting you with specific evidence and cues (42) _______ 
   Conceived in this way, comprehension will not follow exactly the 
same track for each reader. What is in question is not the retrieval of 
an absolute, fixed or Dtrue‖ meaning that can be read off and clocked 
for accuracy, or some timeless relation of the text to the world. (43) 
_______ 
   Such background material inevitably reflects who we are, (44) 
_______This doesn‘t, however, make interpretation merely relative or 
even pointless. Precisely because readers from different historical 
periods, places and social experiences produce different but overlapping 
readings of the same words on the page-including for texts that engage 
with fundamental human concerns-debates about texts can play an 
important role in social discussion of beliefs and values. 
   How we read a given text also depends to some extent on our 
particular interest in reading it. (45)_______such dimensions of read 
suggest-as others introduced later in the book will also do-that we 
bring an implicit (often unacknowledged) agenda to any act of reading. 
It doesn‘t then necessarily follow that one 
   kind of reading is fuller, more advanced or more worthwhile than 
another. Ideally, different kinds of reading inform each other, and act 
as useful reference points for and counterbalances to one another. 
Together, they 
   - 31 - 
   make up the reading component of your overall literacy or 
relationship to your surrounding textual environment. 
   [A] Are we studying that text and trying to respond in a way that 
fulfils the requirement of a given course? Reading it simply for 
pleasure? Skimming it for information? Ways of reading on a train or in 
bed are likely to differ considerably from reading in a seminar room. 
   [B] Factors such as the place and period in which we are reading, 
our gender ethnicity, age and social class will encourage us towards 
certain interpretation but at the same time obscure or even close off 
others. 
   [C] If you are unfamiliar with words or idioms, you guess at their 
meaning, using clues presented in the contest. On the assumption that 
they will become relevant later, you make a mental note of discourse 
entities as well as possible links between them. 
   [D]In effect, you try to reconstruct the likely meanings or effects 
that any given sentence, image or reference might have had: These might 
be the ones the author intended. 
   [E]You make further inferences, for instance, about how the test may 
be significant to you, or about its validity―inferences that form the 
basis of a personal response for which the author will inevitably be far 
less responsible. 
   [F]In plays，novels and narrative poems, characters speak as 
constructs created by the author, not necessarily as mouthpieces for the 
author‘s own thoughts. 
   [G]Rather, we ascribe meanings to test on the basis of interaction 
between what we might call textual and contextual material: between 
kinds of organization or patterning we perceive in a text‘s formal 
structures (so especially its language structures) and various kinds of 
background, social knowledge, belief and attitude that we bring to the

   Within the span of a hundred years, in the seventeenth and early 
eighteenth centuries, a tide if emigration- one of the great folk 
wanderings of history- swept from Europe to America. (46) This movement, 
driven by powerful and diverse motivations, built a nation out of a 
wilderness and, by its nature, shaped the character and destiny of an 
uncharted continent. 
   - 32 - 
   (47) The United States is the product of two principal forces- the 
immigration of European people with their varied ideas, customs, and 
national characteristics and the impact of a new country which modified 
these traits. Of necessity, colonial America was a projection of Europe. 
Across the Atlantic came successive groups of Englishmen, Frenchmen, 
Germans, Scots, Irishmen, Dutchmen, Swedes, and many others who attempt 
to transplant their habits and traditions to new world. (48) But the 
force of geographic conditions peculiar to America, the interplay of the 
varied national groups upon once another, and the sheer difficulty of 
maintaining old-world ways in a raw, new continent caused significant 
changes. These changes were gradual and at first scarcely visible. But 
the result was a new social pattern which, although it resembled 
European society in many ways, has a character that was distinctly 
American. 
   (49) The first shiploads of immigrants bound for the territory which 
is now the United States crossed the Atlantic more than a hundred years 
after the 15th-and- 16th century explorations of North America. In the 
meantime, thriving Spanish colonies had been established in Mexico, the 
West Indies, and South America. These travelers
   to North America came in small, unmercifully overcrowded craft. 
During their six-to twelve-week voyage, they survived on barely enough 
food allotted to them. Many of the ships were lost in storms, many 
passengers died of disease, and infants rarely survived the journey. 
Sometimes storms blew the vessels far off their course, and often calm 
brought unbearably long delay. 
   To the anxious travelers the sight of the American shore brought 
almost inexpressible relief. Said one recorder of events, D The air at 
twelve leagues? distance smelt as sweet as a new-blown garden.‖ The 
colonists? first g
   limpse of the new land was a sight of dense woods. (50) The virgin 
forest with its richness and variety of trees was a real treasure-house 
which extended from Maine all the way down to Georgia. Here was abundant 
fuel and lumber Here was the raw material of houses and furniture, ships 
and potash, dyes and naval stores.

to sign on.‖ he claimed. DWe‘re doing these things because we know 
they help people stay off benefits and help those on benefits get into 
work faster.‖ Help? Really? On first hearing, this was the socially 
concerned chancellor, trying to change lives for the better, complete 
with Dreforms‖ to an obviously indulgent system that demands too 
little effort from the newly unemployed to find work, and subsidises 
laziness. What motivated him, we were to understand, was his zeal 
for Dfundamental fairness‖― protecting the taxpayer, controlling 
spending and ensuring that only the 
   most deserving claimants received their benefits. 
   Losing a job is hurting: you don‘t skip down to the jobcentre with 
a song in your heart, delighted at the prospect of doubling your income 
from the generous state. It is financially terrifying, psychologically 
embarrassing and you know that support is minimal and extraordinarily 
hard to get. You are now not wanted; you support is minimal and 
extraordinarily hard to get. You are now not wanted; you are now 
excluded from the work environment that offers purpose and structure in 
your life. Worse, the crucial income to feed yourself and your family 
and pay the bills has disappeared. Ask anyone newly unemployed what they 
want and the answer is always: a job. 
   But in Osborneland, your first instinct is to fall into dependency 
― permanent dependency if you can get it 
   ― supported by a state only too ready to indulge your falsehood. It 
is as though 20 years of ever-tougher reforms of the job search and 
benefit administration system never happened. The principle of British 
welfare is no longer that you can insure yourself against the risk of 
unemployment and receive unconditional payments if the disaster happens. 
Even the very phrase Djobseeker‘s allowance‖ ― invented in 1996 ― 
is about redefining 
   the unemployed as a Djobseeker‖ who had no mandatory right to a 
benefit he or she has earned through making national insurance 
contributions. Instead, the claimant receives a time-
limited Dallowance,‖ conditional on 
   actively seeking a job; no entitlement and no insurance, at ?71.70 a 
week, one of the least generous in the EU.

   All around the world, lawyers generate more hostility than the 
members of any other profession―with the 
   possible exception of journalism. But there are few places where 
clients have more grounds for complaint than America. 
   During the decade before the economic crisis, spending on legal 
services in America grew twice as fast as inflation. The best lawyers 
made skyscrapers-full of money, tempting ever more students to pile into 
law schools. But most law graduates never get a big-firm job. Many of 
them instead become the kind of nuisance-lawsuit filer that makes the 
tort system a costly nightmare. 
   There are many reasons for this. One is the excessive costs of a 
legal education. There is just one path for a lawyer in most American 
states: a four-year undergraduate degree in some unrelated subject, then 
a three-year law degree at one of 200 law schools authorized by the 
American Bar Association and an expensive preparation for the bar exam. 
This leaves today‘s average law-school graduate with $100,000 of debt 
on top of 
   undergraduate debts. Law-school debt means that many cannot afford 
to go into government or non-profit work, and that they have to work 
fearsomely hard. 
   Reforming the system would help both lawyers and their customers. 
Sensible ideas have been around for a long time, but the state-level 
bodies that govern the profession have been too conservative to 
implement them. One idea is to allow people to study law as an 
undergraduate degree. Another is to let students sit for the bar after 
only two years of law school. If the bar exam is truly a stern enough 
test for a would-be lawyer, those who can sit it earlier should be 
allowed to 
   do so. Students who do not need the extra training could cut their 
debt mountain by a third. 
   The other reason why costs are so high is the restrictive guild-like 
ownership structure of the business. Except in the District of Columbia, 
non-lawyers may not own any share of a law firm. This keeps fees high 
and innovation slow. There is pressure for change from within the 
profession, but opponents of change among the regulators insist that 
keeping outsiders out of a law firm isolates lawyers from the pressure 
to make money 
   - 39 - 
   rather than serve clients ethically. 
   In fact, allowing non-lawyers to own shares in law firms would 
reduce costs and improve services to 
   customers, by encouraging law firms to use technology and to employ 
professional managers to focus on 
   improving firms‘ efficiency. After all, other countries, such as 
Australia and Britain, have started liberalizing their legal professions. 
America should follow. 
   26.a lot of students take up law as their profession due to 
   [A]the growing demand from clients. 
   [B]the increasing pressure of inflation. 
   [C]the prospect of working in big firms. 
   [D]the attraction of financial rewards. 
   27.Which of the following adds to the costs of legal education in 
most American states? 
   [A]Higher tuition fees for undergraduate studies. 
   [B]Admissions approval from the bar association. 
   [C]Pursuing a bachelor‘s degree in another major. 
   [D]Receiving training by professional associations.

considered Drestrictive‖partly because it

   The US$3-million Fundamental physics prize is indeed an interesting 
experiment, as Alexander Polyakov said when he accepted this year‘s 
award in March. And it is far from the only one of its type. As a News 
Feature article in Nature discusses, a string of lucrative awards for 
researchers have joined the Nobel Prizes in recent years. Many, like the 
Fundamental Physics Prize, are funded from the telephone-number-sized 
bank accounts of Internet entrepreneurs. These benefactors have 
succeeded in their chosen fields, they say, and they want to use their 
wealth to draw attention to those who have succeeded in science. 
   What‘s not to like? Quite a lot, according to a handful of 
scientists quoted in the News Feature. You cannot buy class, as the old 
saying goes, and these upstart entrepreneurs cannot buy their prizes the 
prestige of the Nobels, The new awards are an exercise in self-promotion 
for those behind them, say scientists. They could distort the 
achievement-based system of peer-review-led research. They could cement 
the status quo of peer-reviewed research. They do not fund peer-reviewed 
research. They perpetuate the myth of the lone genius. 
   The goals of the prize-givers seem as scattered as the criticism. 
Some want to shock, others to draw people into science, or to better 
reward those who have made their careers in research. 
   As Nature has pointed out before, there are some legitimate concerns 
about how science prizes―both new 
   and old―are distributed. The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, 
launched this year, takes an unrepresentative view of what the life 
sciences include. But the Nobel Foundation‘s limit of three recipients 
   per prize, each of whom must still be living, has long been outgrown 
by the collaborative nature of modern research―as will be demonstrated 
by the inevitable row over who is ignored when it comes to acknowledging 
   - 41 - 
   the discovery of the Higgs boson. The Nobels were, of course, 
themselves set up by a very rich individual who 
   had decided what he wanted to do with his own money. Time, rather 
than intention, has given them legitimacy. 
   As much as some scientists may complain about the new awards, two 
things seem clear. First, most researchers would accept such a prize if 
they were offered one. Second, it is surely a good thing that the money 
   and attention come to science rather than go elsewhere, It is fair 
to criticize and question the mechanism―that 
   is the culture of research, after all―but it is the prize-
givers‘ money to do with as they please. It is wise to take such gifts 
with gratitude and grace. 
   31. The Fundamental Physics Prize is seen as 
   [A]a symbol of the entrepreneurs‘ wealth. 
   [B]a possible replacement of the Nobel Prizes. 
   [C]an example of bankers‘ investments. 
   [D]a handsome reward for researchers. 
   32. The critics think that the new awards will most benefit 
   [A]the profit-oriented scientists. 
   [B]the founders of the new awards. 
   [C]the achievement-based system. 
   [D]peer-review-led research. 
   33. The discovery of the Higgs boson is a typical case which 
involves 
   [A]controversies over the recipients‘ status. 
   [B]the joint effort of modern researchers. 
   [C]legitimate concerns over the new prizes. 
   [D]the demonstration of research findings. 
   34. According to Paragraph 4,which of the following is true of the 
Nobels? 
   [A]Their endurance has done justice to them. 
   - 42 - 
   [B]Their legitimacy has long been in dispute. 
   [C]They are the most representative honor. 
   [D]History has never cast doubt on them. 
   35.The author believes that the now awards are 
   [A]acceptable despite the criticism. 
   [B]harmful to the culture of research. 
   [C]subject to undesirable changes. 
   [D]unworthy of public attention.

   DThe Heart of the Matter,‖ the just-released report by the 
American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS), 
   deserves praise for affirming the importance of the humanities and 
social sciences to the prosperity and security of liberal democracy in 
America. Regrettably, however, the report‘s failure to address the true 
nature 
   of the crisis facing liberal education may cause more harm than good. 
   In 2010, leading congressional Democrats and Republicans sent 
letters to the AAAS asking that it identify actions that could be taken 
by Dfederal, state and local governments, universities, foundations, 
educators, individual benefactors and others‖ to Dmaintain national 
excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship and 
education.‖ In response, the American Academy formed the Commission on 
the Humanities 
   and Social Sciences. Among the commission‘s 51 members are top-
tier-university presidents, scholars, 
   lawyers, judges, and business executives, as well as prominent 
figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music and journalism. 
   The goals identified in the report are generally admirable. Because 
representative government presupposes an informed citizenry, the report 
supports full literacy; stresses the study of history and government, 
particularly American history and American government; and encourages 
the use of new digital technologies. To encourage innovation and 
competition, the report calls for increased investment in research, the 
crafting of coherent curricula that improve students‘ ability to solve 
problems and communicate effectively in the 21st 
   - 43 - 
   century, increased funding for teachers and the encouragement of 
scholars to bring their learning to bear on the great challenges of the 
day. The report also advocates greater study of foreign languages, 
international affairs and the expansion of study abroad programs. 
   Unfortunately, despite 2? years in the making, "The Heart of the 
Matter" never gets to the heart of the matter: the illiberal nature of 
liberal education at our leading colleges and universities. The 
commission ignores that for several decades America's colleges and 
universities have produced graduates who don‘t know the content and 
character of liberal education and are thus deprived of its benefits. 
Sadly, the spirit of inquiry once at home on campus has been replaced by 
the use of the humanities and social sciences as vehicles for 
publicizing Dprogressive,‖ or left-liberal propaganda. 
   Today, professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of 
history and progressive public policy as the proper subject of study 
while portraying conservative or classical liberal ideas―such as free 
markets and 
   self-reliance―as falling outside the boundaries of routine, and 
sometimes legitimate, intellectual investigation. 
   The AAAS displays great enthusiasm for liberal education. Yet its 
report may well set back reform by obscuring the depth and breadth of 
the challenge that Congress asked it to illuminate. 
   36. According to Paragraph 1, what is the author‘s attitude toward 
the AAAS‘s report? 
   [A] Critical 
   [B] Appreciative 
   [C] Contemptuous 
   [D] Tolerant 
   37. Influential figures in the Congress required that the AAAS 
report on how to 
   [A] retain people‘s interest in liberal education 
   [B] define the government‘s role in education 
   [C] keep a leading position in liberal education 
   [D] safeguard individuals‘ rights to education 
   38. According to Paragraph 3, the report suggests 
   - 44 - 
   [A] an exclusive study of American history 
   [B] a greater emphasis on theoretical subjects 
   [C] the application of emerging technologies 
   [D] funding for the study of foreign languages 
   39. The author implies in Paragraph 5 that professors are 
   [A] supportive of free markets 
   [B] cautious about intellectual investigation 
   [C] conservative about public policy 
   [D] biased against classical liberal ideas 
   40. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

on the ANSWER SHEET (10 points) [A] Some archaeological sites have 
always been easily observable―for example, the Parthenon in Athens, 
   Greece, the pyramids of Giza in Egypt; and the megaliths of 
Stonehenge in southern England. But these sites are exceptions to the 
norm. Most archaeological sites have been located by means of careful 
searching, while many others have been discovered by accident. Olduvai 
Gorge, an early hominid site in Tanzania, was found 
   - 45 - 
   by a butterfly hunter who literally fell into its deep valley in 
1911. Thousands of Aztec artifacts came to light during the digging of 
the Mexico City subway in the 1970s. 
   [B]In another case, American archaeologists Rene Million and George 
Cowgill spent years systematically mapping the entire city of 
Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico near what is now Mexico City. At its 
peak around AD 600, this city was one of the largest human settlements 
in the world. The researchers mapped not only the city‘s vast and 
ornate ceremonial areas, but also hundreds of simpler apartment 
complexes where common people lived. 
   [C] How do archaeologists know where to find what they are looking 
for when there is nothing visible on the surface of the ground? 
Typically, they survey and sample (make test excavations on) large areas 
of terrain to determine where excavation will yield useful information. 
Surveys and test samples have also become important for understanding 
the larger landscapes that contain archaeological sites. 
   [D] Surveys can cover a single large settlement or entire landscapes. 
In one case, many researchers working around the ancient Maya city of 
Copan, Honduras, have located hundreds of small rural villages and 
individual dwellings by using aerial photographs and by making surveys 
on foot. The resulting settlement maps show how the distribution and 
density of the rural population around the city changed dramatically 
between AD 500 and 850, when Copan collapsed. 
   [E] To find their sites, archaeologists today rely heavily on 
systematic survey methods and a variety of high-technology tools and 
techniques. Airborne technologies, such as different types of radar and 
photographic equipment carried by airplanes or spacecraft, allow 
archaeologists to learn about what lies beneath the ground without 
digging. Aerial surveys locate general areas of interest or larger 
buried features, such as ancient buildings or fields. 
   [F] Most archaeological sites, however, are discovered by 
archaeologists who have set out to look for them. Such searches can take 
years. British archaeologist Howard Carter knew that the tomb of the 
Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun existed from information found in other 
sites. Carter sifted through rubble in the Valley of the Kings for seven 
years before he located the tomb in 1922. In the late 1800s British 
archaeologist Sir Arthur Evan combed antique dealers‘ stores in Athens, 
Greece. He was searching for tiny engraved seals attributed to the 
ancient Mycenaean culture that dominated Greece from the 1400s to 1200s 
BC. Evans‘s interpretations of 
   these engravings eventually led him to find the Minoan palace at 
Knossos (Knossós) on the island of Crete, in 1900. 
   - 46 - 
   [G] Ground surveys allow archaeologists to pinpoint the places where 
digs will be successful. Most ground surveys involve a lot of walking, 
looking for surface clues such as small fragments of pottery. They often 
include a certain amount of digging to test for buried materials at 
selected points across a landscape. Archaeologists also may locate 
buried remains by using such technologies as ground radar, magnetic-
field recording, and metal detectors. Archaeologists commonly use 
computers to map sites and the landscapes around sites. Two and three-
dimensional maps are helpful tools in planning excavations, illustrating 
how sites look, and presenting the results of archaeological research.

   Music means different things to different people and sometimes even 
different things to the same person at different moments of his life. It 
might be poetic, philosophical, sensual, or mathematical, but in any 
case it must, in my view, have something to do with the soul of the 
human being. Hence it is metaphysical; but the means of expression is 
purely and exclusively physical: sound. I believe it is precisely this 
permanent coexistence of metaphysical message through physical means 
that is the strength of music. (46)It is also the reason why when we try 
to describe music with words, all we can do is articulate our reactions 
to it, and not grasp music itself. 
   Beethoven‘s importance in music has been principally defined by the 
revolutionary nature of his 
   compositions. He freed music from hitherto prevailing conventions of 
harmony and structure. Sometimes I feel in his late works a will to 
break all signs of continuity. The music is abrupt and seemingly 
disconnected, as in the last piano sonata. In musical expression, he did 
not feel restrained by the weight of convention. (47)By all accounts he 
was a freethinking person, and a courageous one, and I find courage an 
essential quality for the understanding, let alone the performance, of 
his works. 
   This courageous attitude in fact becomes a requirement for the 
performers of Beethoven‘s music. His 
   - 47 - 
   compositions demand the performer to show courage, for example in 
the use of dynamics. (48)Beethoven‘s habit of increasing the volume 
with an intense crescendo and then abruptly following it with a sudden 
soft passage was only rarely used by composers before him. 
   Beethoven was a deeply political man in the broadest sense of the 
word. He was not interested in daily politics, but concerned with 
questions of moral behavior and the larger questions of right and wrong 
affecting the entire society. (49)Especially significant was his view of 
freedom, which, for him, was associated with the rights and 
responsibilities of the individual: he advocated freedom of thought and 
of personal expression. 
   Beethoven‘s music tends to move from chaos to order as if order 
were an imperative of human existence. For him, order does not result 
from forgetting or ignoring the disorders that plague our existence; 
order is a necessary development, an improvement that may lead to the 
Greek ideal of spiritual elevation. It is not by chance that the Funeral 
March is not the last movement of the Eroica Symphony, but the second, 
so that suffering does not have the last word. (50)One could interpret 
much of the work of Beethoven by saying that suffering is inevitable, 
but the courage to fight it renders life worth living.

   People are, on the whole, poor at considering background information

theory, the 9 of an applicant should not depend on the few others 10 
randomly for interview during the same day, but Dr Simonsohn suspected 
the truth was 11 . 
   He studied the results of 9,323 MBA interviews, 12 by 31 admissions 
officers. The interviewers had 13 applicants on a scale of one to five. 
This scale 14 numerous factors into consideration. The scores were 15 
used in conjunction with an applicant's score on the Graduate Management 
Admission Test, or GMAT, a standardised exam which is 16 out of 800 
points, to make a decision on whether to accept him or her. 
   Dr Simonsohn found if the score of the previous candidate in a daily

average of 0.075 points. This might sound small, but to 19 the effects

   In the 2006 film version of The Devil Wears Prada, Miranda Priestly, 
played by Meryl Streep, scold her unattractive assistant for imagining 
that high fashion doesn‘t affect her. Priestly explains how the deep 
blue 
   color of the assistant‘s sweater descended over the years from 
fashion shows to department stores and to the bargain bin in which the 
poor girl doubtless found her garment. 
   This top-down conception of the fashion business couldn‘t be more 
out of date or at odds with feverish 
   world described in Overdressed, Elizabeth Cline‘s three-year 
indictment of Dfast fashion‖. In the last decades 
   or so, advances in technology have allowed mass-market labels such 
as Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo to react to trends more quickly and anticipate 
demand more precisely. Quckier turnrounds mean less wasted inventory, 
more frequent releases, and more profit. Those labels encourage style-
conscious consumers to see clothes as disposal―― meant to last only a 
wash or two, although they don‘t advertise that――and to renew their 
   wardrobe every few weeks. By offering on-trend items at dirt-cheap 
prices, Cline argues, these brands have hijacked fashion cycles, shaking 
all industry long accustomed to a seasonal pace. 
   The victims of this revolution, of course, are not limited to 
designers. For H&M to offer a 5.95 knit miniskirt in all its 2300-plus 
stores around the world, it must rely on low-wage, overseas labor, order 
in volumes that strain natural resources, and use massive amount of 
harmful chemicals. 
   Overdressed is the fashion world‘s answer to consumer activist 
bestsellers like Michael Pollan‘s The Omnivore‘s Dilemma. Mass-
produced clothing, like fast food, fills a hunger and need, yet is non-
durable, and wasteful,‖ Cline argues, Americans, she finds, buy roughly 
20 billion garments a year――about 64 items per 
   person――and no matter how much they give away, this excess leads 
to waste. 
   Towards the end of Overdressed, Cline introduced her ideal, a 
Brooklyn woman named SKB, who, since 2008 has make all of her own 
clothes――and beautifully. But as Cline is the first to note, it took

   An old saying has it that half of all advertising budgets are 
wasted-the trouble is, no one knows which 
   half . In the internet age, at least in theory ,this fraction can be 
much reduced . By watching what people search 
   for, click on and say online, companies can aim Dbehavioural‖ ads 
at those most likely to buy. 
   - 52 - 
   In the past couple of weeks a quarrel has illustrated the value to 
advertisers of such fine-grained information: Should advertisers assume 
that people are happy to be tracked and sent behavioural ads? Or should 
they have explicit permission? 
   In December 2010 America's Federal Trade Cornmission (FTC) proposed 
adding a "do not track "(DNT) option to internet browsers ,so that users 
could tell adwertisers that they did not want to be 
followed .Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Apple's Safari both offer 
DNT ;Google's Chrome is due to do so this year. In February the FTC and 
Digltal Adwertising Alliance (DAA) agreed that the industry would get 
cracking on responging to DNT requests. 
   On May 31st Microsoft Set off the row: It said that Internet 
Explorer 10,the version due to appear windows 8, would have DNT as a 
default. 
   It is not yet clear how advertisers will respond. Geting a DNT 
signal does not oblige anyone to stop tracking, although some companies 
have promised to do so. Unable to tell whether someone really objects to 
behavioural ads or whether they are sticking with Microsoft‘s default, 
some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway. 
   Also unclear is why Microsoft has gone it alone. Atter all, it has 
an ad business too, which it says will comply with DNT requests, though 
it is still working out how. If it is trying to upset Google, which 
relies almost wholly on default will become the norm. DNT does not seem 
an obviously huge selling point for windows 8-though the firm has 
compared some of its other products favourably with Google's on that 
count before. Brendon Lynch, Microsoft's chief privacy officer, 
bloggde:"we believe consumers should have more control." Could it really 
be that simple? 
   26. It is suggested in paragraph 1 that Dbehavioural‖ ads help 
advertisers to: 
   [A] ease competition among themselves 
   [B] lower their operational costs 
   [C] avoid complaints from consumers 
   [D]provide better online services 
   27. DThe industry‖ (Line 6,Para.3) refers to: 
   [A] online advertisers 
   [B] e-commerce conductors 
   [C] digital information analysis 
   [D]internet browser developers 
   28. Bob Liodice holds that setting DNT as a default 
   [A] many cut the number of junk ads 
   [B] fails to affect the ad industry 
   [C] will not benefit consumers 
   [D]goes against human nature 
   29. which of the following is ture according to Paragraph.6?

   Up until a few decades ago, our visions of the future were largely - 
though by no means uniformly - glowingly positive. Science and 
technology would cure all the ills of humanity, leading to lives of 
fulfillment and opportunity for all. 
   Now utopia has grown unfashionable, as we have gained a deeper 
appreciation of the range of threats facing us, from asteroid strike to 
epidemic flu and to climate change. You might even be tempted to assume 
that humanity has little future to look forward to. 
   But such gloominess is misplaced. The fossil record shows that many 
species have endured for millions of years - so why shouldn't we? Take a 
broader look at our species' place in the universe, and it becomes clear 
that we have an excellent chance of surviving for tens, if not hundreds, 
of thousands of years . Look up Homo sapiens in the "Red List" of 
threatened species of the International Union for the Conversation of 
Nature (IUCN) ,and you will read: "Listed as Least Concern as the 
species is very widely distributed, adaptable, currently increasing, and 
there are no major threats resulting in an overall population decline." 
   So what does our deep future hold? A growing number of researchers 
and organisations are now thinking seriously about that question. For 
example, the Long Now Foundation has its flagship project a medical 
clock that is designed to still be marking time thousands of years 
hence . 
   Perhaps willfully , it may be easier to think about such lengthy 
timescales than about the more immediate future. The potential evolution 
of today's technology, and its social consequences, is dazzlingly 
complicated, and it's perhaps best left to science fiction writers and 
futurologists to explore the many possibilities we can envisage. That's 
one reason why we have launched Arc, a new publication dedicated to the 
near future. 
   But take a longer view and there is a surprising amount that we can 
say with considerable assurance. As so often, the past holds the key to 
the future: we have now identified enough of the long-term patterns 
shaping the history of the planet, and our species, to make evidence-
based forecasts about the situations in which our descendants will find 
themselves. 
   - 54 - 
   This long perspective makes the pessimistic view of our prospects 
seem more likely to be a passing fad. To be 
   sure, the future is not all rosy. But we are now knowledgeable 
enough to reduce many of the risks that 
   threatened the existence of earlier humans, and to improve the lot 
of those to come. 
   31. Our vision of the future used to be inspired by 
   [A] our desire for lives of fulfillment 
   [B] our faith in science and technology 
   [C] our awareness of potential risks 
   [D] our belief in equal opportunity 
   32. The IUCN‘s DRed List‖ suggest that human being are 
   [A] a sustained species 
   [B] a threaten to the environment 
   [C] the world‘s dominant power 
   [D] a misplaced race 
   33. Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 5? 
   [A] Arc helps limit the scope of futurological studies. 
   [B] Technology offers solutions to social problem. 
   [C] The interest in science fiction is on the rise. 
   [D] Our Immediate future is hard to conceive.

   [A] explore our planet‘s abundant resources 
   [B] adopt an optimistic view of the world 
   [C] draw on our experience from the past

   On a five to three vote, the Supreme Court knocked out much of 
Arizona‘s immigration law Monday-a 
   modest policy victory for the Obama Administration. But on the more 
important matter of the Constitution,the 
   decision was an 8-0 defeat for the Administration‘s effort to upset 
the balance of power between the federal 
   government and the states. 
   In Arizona v. United States, the majority overturned three of the 
four contested provisions of Arizona‘s 
   controversial plan to have state and local police enforce federal 
immigration law. The Constitutional principles 
   - 55 - 
   that Washington alone has the power to Destablish a uniform Rule of 
Naturalization ‖and that federal laws 
   precede state laws are noncontroversial . Arizona had attempted to 
fashion state policies that ran parallel to the existing federal ones. 
   Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and 
the Court‘s liberals, ruled that the state 
   flew too close to the federal sun. On the overturned provisions the 
majority held the congress had deliberately Doccupied the field‖ and 
Arizona had thus intruded on the federal‘s privileged powers. 
   However,the Justices said that Arizona police would be allowed to 
verify the legal status of people who come in contact with law 
enforcement.That‘s because Congress has always envisioned joint 
federal-state 
   immigration enforcement and explicitly encourages state officers to 
share information and cooperate with federal colleagues. 
   Two of the three objecting Justice-Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas-
agreed with this Constitutional logic but disagreed about which Arizona 
rules conflicted with the federal statute.The only major objection came 
from Justice Antonin Scalia,who offered an even more robust defense of 
state privileges going back to the alien and Sedition Acts. 
   The 8-0 objection to President Obama turns on what Justice Samuel 
Alito describes in his objection as Da 
   shocking assertion assertion of federal executive power‖.The White 
House argued that Arizona‘s laws conflicted with its enforcement 
priorities,even if state laws complied with federal statutes to the 
letter.In effect, the White House claimed that it could invalidate any 
otherwise legitimate state law that it disagrees with . 
   Some powers do belong exclusively to the federal government, and 
control of citizenship and the borders is among them. But if Congress 
wanted to prevent states from using their own resources to check 
immigration status, it could. It never did so. The administration was in 
essence asserting that because it didn‘t want to carry out Congress‘s 
immigration wishes, no state should be allowed to do so either. Every 
Justice rightly rejected this remarkable claim. 
   36. Three provisions of Arizona‘s plan were overturned because they 
   [A] deprived the federal police of Constitutional powers. 
   [B] disturbed the power balance between different states. 
   [C] overstepped the authority of federal immigration law. 
   [D] contradicted both the federal and state policies. 
   37. On which of the following did the Justices agree,according to 
Paragraph4? 
   [A] Federal officers‘ duty to withhold immigrants‘information. 
   [B] States‘ independence from federal immigration law. 
   [C] States‘ legitimate role in immigration enforcement. 
   [D] Congress‘s intervention in immigration enforcement. 
   38. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that the Alien and Sedition 
Acts 
   [A] violated the Constitution. 
   [B] undermined the states‘ interests. 
   - 56 - 
   [C] supported the federal statute. 
   [D] stood in favor of the states. 
   39. The White House claims that its power of enforcement 
   [A] outweighs that held by the states. 
   [B] is dependent on the states‘ support. 
   [C] is established by federal statutes. 
   [D] rarely goes against state laws. 
   40. What can be learned from the last paragraph? 
   [A] Immigration issues are usually decided by Congress. 
   [B] Justices intended to check the power of the Administrstion. 
   [C] Justices wanted to strengthen its coordination with Congress. 
   [D] The Administration is dominant over immigration issues.

   The social sciences are flourishing.As of 2005,there were almost 
half a million professional social scientists from all fields in the 
world, working both inside and outside academia. According to the World 
Social Science Report 2010,the number of social-science students 
worldwide has swollen by about 11% every year since 2000. 
   Yet this enormous resource in not contributing enough to today‘s 
global challenges including climate 
   change, security,sustainable development and 
health.(41)______Humanity has the necessary agro-technological tools to 
eradicate hunger , from genetically engineered crops to arificial 
fertilizers . Here , too, the problems are social: the organization and 
distribution of food, wealth and prosperity. 
   (42)____This is a shame―the community should be grasping the 
opportunity to raise its influence in the real world. To paraphrase the 
great social scientist Joseph Schumpeter:there is no radical innovation 
without creative destruction . 
   Today ,the social sciences are largely focused on disciplinary 
problems and internal scholarly debates,rather than on topics with 
external impact. 
   Analyses reveal that the number of papers including the 
keywords Denvironmental changed‖ or Dclimate change‖ have increased 
rapidly since 2004,(43)____ 
   - 57 - 
   When social scientists do tackle practical issues ,their scope is 
often local:Belgium is interested mainly in the effects of poverty on 
Belgium for example .And whether the community‘s work contributes much 
to an overall accumulation of knowledge is doubtful. 
   The problem is not necessarily the amount of available funding 
(44)____this is an adequate amount so long as it is aimed in the right 
direction. Social scientists who complain about a lack of funding should 
not expect more in today‘s economic climate. 
   The trick is to direct these funds better.The European Union 
Framework funding programs have long had a category specifically 
targeted at social scientists.This year,it was proposed that system be 
changed:Horizon 2020,a new program to be enacted in 2014,would not have 
such a category ,This has resulted in protests from social 
scientists.But the intention is not to neglect social science ; 
rather ,the complete opposite.(45)____That should create more 
collaborative endeavors and help to develop projects aimed directly at 
solving global problems. 
   [A] It could be that we are evolving two communities of social 
   scientists:one that is discipline-oriented and publishing in highly 
   specialized journals,and one that is problem-oriented and publishing 
   elsewhere,such as policy briefs. 
   [B] However,the numbers are still small:in 2010,about 1,600 of the 
   100,000 social-sciences papers published globally included one of 
these 
   Keywords. 
   [C] the idea is to force social to integrate their work with other 
categories, including health and demographic change food security, 
marine research and the bio-economy, clear, efficient energy; and 
inclusive, innovative and secure societies. 
   [D] the solution is to change the mindset of the academic community, 
and what it considers to be its main goal. Global challenges and social 
innovation ought to receive much more attention from scientists, 
especially the young ones. 
   [E] These issues all have root causes in human behavior . all 
require behavioral change and social innovations , as well as 
technological development . Stemming climate change , for example , is 
as much about changing consumption patterns and promoting tax acceptance 
as it is about developing clean energy. [F] Despite these factors , many 
social scientists seem reluctant to tackle such problems . And in 
Europe , some are up in arms over a proposal to drop a specific funding 
category for social-science research and to integrate it within cross-
cutting topics of sustainable development . 
   [G] During the late 1990s , national spending on social sciences and 
the humanities as a percentage of all research and development funds-
including government, higher education, non-profit and corporate -varied 
from around 4% to 25%; in most European nations , it is about 15%.

   It is speculated that gardens arise from a basic need in the 
individuals who made them: the need for creative expression. There is no 
doubt that gardens evidence an impossible urge to create, express, 
fashion, and beautify and that self-expression is a basic human urge; 
(46) Yet when one looks at the photographs of the garden created by the 
homeless, it strikes one that , for all their diversity of styles, these 
gardens speak os various other fundamental urges, beyond that of 
decoration and creative expression. 
   One of these urges had to do with creating a state of peace in the 
midst of turbulence, a Dstill point of the turning world,‖ to borrow a 
phrase from T. S. Eliot. (47)A sacred place of peace, however crude it 
may be, is a distinctly human need, as opposed to shelter, which is a 
distinctly animal need. This distinction is so much so that where the 
latter is lacking, as it is for these unlikely gardens, the foemer 
becomes all the more urgent. Composure is a state of mind made possible 
by the structuring of one‘s relation to one‘s environment. (48) The 
   gardens of the homeless which are in effect homeless gardens 
introduce from into an urban environment where it either didn‘t exist 
or was not discernible as such. In so doing they give composure to a 
segment of the 
   inarticulate environment in which they take their stand. 
   Another urge or need that these gardens appear to respond to, or to 
arise from is so intrinsic that we are barely ever conscious of its 
abiding claims on us. When we are deprived of green, of plants, of trees, 
(49)most of us give into a demoralization of spirit which we usually 
blame on some psychological conditions, until one day we find ourselves 
in garden and feel the expression vanish as if by magic. In most of the 
homeless gardens of New York City the actual cultivation of plants is 
unfeasible, yet even so the compositions often seem to represent 
attempts to call arrangement of materials, an institution of colors, 
small pool of water, and a frequent presence of petals or leaves as well 
as of stuffed animals. On display here are various fantasy elements 
whose reference, at some basic level, seems to be the natural world. 
(50)It is this implicit or explicit reference to nature that fully 
justifies the use of word garden though in a Dliberated‖ sense, to 
describe these synthetic 
   constructions. In them we can see biophilia- a yearning for contact 
with nonhuman life-assuming uncanny representational forms.

   Come on CEverybody‘s doing it. That whispered message, half 
invitation and half forcing, is what most of us 
   think of when we hear the words peer pressure. It usually leads to 
no good-drinking, drugs and casual sex. But in her new book Join the 
Club, Tina Rosenberg contends that peer pressure can also be a positive 
force through what she calls the social cure, in which organizations and 
officials use the power of group dynamics to help individuals improve 
their lives and possibly the word. 
   Rosenberg, the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, offers a host of 
example of the social cure in action: In South Carolina, a state-
sponsored antismoking program called Rage Against the Haze sets out to 
make cigarettes uncool. In South Africa, an HIV-prevention initiative 
known as LoveLife recruits young people to promote safe sex among their 
peers. 
   The idea seems promising，and Rosenberg is a perceptive observer. 
Her critique of the lameness of many pubic-health campaigns is spot-on: 
they fail to mobilize peer pressure for healthy habits, and they 
demonstrate a seriously flawed understanding of psychology.‖ Dare to be 
different, please don‘t smoke!‖ pleads one 
   billboard campaign aimed at reducing smoking among teenagers-
teenagers, who desire nothing more than fitting in. Rosenberg argues 
convincingly that public-health advocates ought to take a page from 
advertisers, so skilled at applying peer pressure. 
   But on the general effectiveness of the social cure, Rosenberg is 
less persuasive. Join the Club is filled with too much irrelevant detail 
and not enough exploration of the social and biological factors that 
make peer pressure so powerful. The most glaring flaw of the social cure 
as it‘s presented here is that it doesn‘t work very well for very long. 
Rage Against the Haze failed once state funding was cut. Evidence that 
the LoveLife program produces lasting changes is limited and mixed. 
   There‘s no doubt that our peer groups exert enormous influence on 
our behavior. An emerging body of research shows that positive health 
habits-as well as negative ones-spread through networks of friends via 
social communication. This is a subtle form of peer pressure: we 
unconsciously imitate the behavior we see 
   - 62 - 
   every day. 
   Far less certain, however, is how successfully experts and 
bureaucrats can select our peer groups and steer 
   their activities in virtuous directions. It‘s like the teacher who 
breaks up the troublemakers in the back row by pairing them with better-
behaved classmates. The tactic never really works. And that‘s the 
problem with a social cure engineered from the outside: in the real 
world, as in school, we insist on choosing our own friends. 
   21. According to the first paragraph, peer pressure often emerges as 
   [A] a supplement to the social cure 
   [B] a stimulus to group dynamics 
   [C] an obstacle to school progress 
   [D] a cause of undesirable behaviors 
   22. Rosenberg holds that public advocates should

   A deal is a deal-except, apparently ,when Entergy is involved. The 
company, a major energy supplier in New England, provoked justified 
outrage in Vermont last week when it announced it was reneging on a 
longstanding commitment to abide by the strict nuclear regulations. 
   Instead, the company has done precisely what it had long promised it 
would not challenge the constitutionality of Vermont‘s rules in the 
federal court, as part of a desperate effort to keep its Vermont 
   Yankee nuclear power plant running. It‘s a stunning move. 
   The conflict has been surfacing since 2002, when the corporation 
bought Vermont‘s only nuclear power 
   - 63 - 
   plant, an aging reactor in Vernon. As a condition of receiving state 
approval for the sale, the company agreed to seek permission from state 
regulators to operate past 2012. In 2006, the state went a step further, 
requiring that any extension of the plant‘s license be subject to 
Vermont legislature‘s approval. Then, too, the company went 
   along. 
   Either Entergy never really intended to live by those commitments, 
or it simply didn‘t foresee what would happen next. A string of 
accidents, including the partial collapse of a cooling tower in 207 and 
the discovery of an underground pipe system leakage, raised serious 
questions about both Vermont Yankee‘s safety and Entergy‘s 
managementC especially after the company made misleading statements 
about the pipe. Enraged by Entergy‘s behavior, the Vermont Senate voted 
26 to 4 last year against allowing an extension. 
   Now the company is suddenly claiming that the 2002 agreement is 
invalid because of the 2006 legislation, and that only the federal 
government has regulatory power over nuclear issues. The legal issues in 
the case are obscure: whereas the Supreme Court has ruled that states do 
have some regulatory authority over nuclear power, legal scholars say 
that Vermont case will offer a precedent-setting test of how far those 
powers extend. Certainly, there are valid concerns about the patchwork 
regulations that could result if every state sets its own rules. But had 
Entergy kept its word, that debate would be beside the point. 
   The company seems to have concluded that its reputation in Vermont 
is already so damaged that it has noting left to lose by going to war 
with the state. But there should be consequences. Permission to run a 
nuclear plant is a poblic trust. Entergy runs 11 other reactors in the 
United States, including Pilgrim Nuclear station in Plymouth. Pledging 
to run Pilgrim safely, the company has applied for federal permission to 
keep it open for another 20 years. But as the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC) reviews the company‘s application, it should keep it 
mind what promises from Entergy are worth.

   In the idealized version of how science is done, facts about the 
world are waiting to be observed and collected by objective researchers 
who use the scientific method to carry out their work. But in the 
everyday practice of science, discovery frequently follows an ambiguous 
and complicated route. We aim to be objective, but we cannot escape the 
context of our unique life experience. Prior knowledge and interest 
influence what we experience, what we think our experiences mean, and 
the subsequent actions we take. Opportunities for misinterpretation, 
error, and self-deception abound. 
   Consequently, discovery claims should be thought of as protoscience. 
Similar to newly staked mining claims, they are full of potential. But 
it takes collective scrutiny and acceptance to transform a discovery 
claim into a mature discovery. This is the credibility process, through 
which the individual researcher‘s me, here, now becomes the 
community‘s anyone, anywhere, anytime. Objective knowledge is the goal, 
not the starting point. 
   Once a discovery claim becomes public, the discoverer receives 
intellectual credit. But, unlike with mining claims, the community takes 
control of what happens next. Within the complex social structure of the 
scientific community, researchers make discoveries; editors and 
reviewers act as gatekeepers by controlling the publication process; 
other scientists use the new finding to suit their own purposes; and 
finally, the public (including other scientists) receives the new 
discovery and possibly accompanying technology. As a discovery claim 
works it through the community, the interaction and confrontation 
between shared and competing beliefs about the science and the 
technology involved transforms an individual‘s discovery claim into the 
   community‘s credible discovery. 
   Two paradoxes exist throughout this credibility process. First, 
scientific work tends to focus on some aspect of prevailing Knowledge 
that is viewed as incomplete or incorrect. Little reward accompanies 
duplication and confirmation of what is already known and believed. The 
goal is new-search, not re-search. Not surprisingly, newly published 
discovery claims and credible discoveries that appear to be important 
and convincing will always be open to challenge and potential 
modification or refutation by future researchers. Second, novelty itself 
frequently provokes disbelief. Nobel Laureate and physiologist Albert 
Azent-Gyorgyi once described discovery as Dseeing what everybody has 
seen and thinking what nobody has thought.‖ But thinking what nobody 
else has thought and telling others what they have missed may not change 
their views. Sometimes years are required for truly novel discovery 
claims to be accepted and appreciated. 
   In the end, credibility Dhappens‖ to a discovery claim C a 
process that corresponds to what philosopher 
   Annette Baier has described as the commons of the mind. DWe reason 
together, challenge, revise, and complete 
   - 65 - 
   each other‘s reasoning and each other‘s conceptions of reason.‖ 
   31. According to the first paragraph, the process of discovery is 
characterized by its 
   [A] uncertainty and complexity. 
   [B] misconception and deceptiveness. 
   [C] logicality and objectivity. 
   [D] systematicness and regularity. 
   32. It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that credibility process 
requires 
   [A] strict inspection. 
   [B]shared efforts. 
   [C] individual wisdom. 
   [D]persistent innovation. 
   33.Paragraph 3 shows that a discovery claim becomes credible after 
it 
   [A] has attracted the attention of the general public. 
   [B]has been examined by the scientific community. 
   [C] has received recognition from editors and reviewers.

   [A] scientific claims will survive challenges.

   [D]scientific work calls for a critical mind.

   If the trade unionist Jimmy Hoffa were alive today, he would 
probably represent civil servant. When Hoffa‘s Teamsters were in their 
prime in 1960, only one in ten American government workers belonged to a 
union; now 36% do. In 2009 the number of unionists in America‘s public 
sector passed that of their fellow members 
   in the private sector. In Britain, more than half of public-sector 
workers but only about 15% of private-sector ones are unionized. 
   There are three reasons for the public-sector unions‘ thriving. 
First, they can shut things down without 
   suffering much in the way of consequences. Second, they are mostly 
bright and well-educated. A quarter of America‘s public-sector workers 
have a university degree. Third, they now dominate left-of-centre 
politics. Some of their ties go back a long way. Britain‘s Labor Party, 
as its name implies, has long been associated with trade unionism. Its 
current leader, Ed Miliband, owes his position to votes from public-
sector unions. 
   At the state level their influence can be even more fearsome. Mark 
Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute 
   - 66 - 
   of California points out that much of the state‘s budget is 
patrolled by unions. The teachers‘ unions keep an eye on schools, the 
CCPOA on prisons and a variety of labor groups on health care. 
   In many rich countries average wages in the state sector are higher 
than in the private one. But the real gains come in benefits and work 
practices. Politicians have repeatedly Dbackloaded‖ public-sector pay 
deals, keeping 
   the pay increases modest but adding to holidays and especially 
pensions that are already generous. 
   Reform has been vigorously opposed, perhaps most egregiously in 
education, where charter schools, academies and merit pay all faced 
drawn-out battles. Even though there is plenty of evidence that the 
quality of the teachers is the most important variable, 
teachers‘ unions have fought against getting rid of bad ones and 
promoting good ones. 
   As the cost to everyone else has become clearer, politicians have 
begun to clamp down. In Wisconsin the unions have rallied thousands of 
supporters against Scott Walker, the hardline Republican governor. But 
many within the public sector suffer under the current system, too. 
   John Donahue at Harvard‘s Kennedy School points out that the norms 
of culture in Western civil services 
   suit those who want to stay put but is bad for high achievers. The 
only American public-sector workers who earn well above $250,000 a year 
are university sports coaches and the president of the United States. 
Bankers‘ fat pay packets have attracted much criticism, but a public-
sector system that does not reward high achievers may be a much bigger 
problem for America. 
   36. It can be learned from the first paragraph that 
   [A] Teamsters still have a large body of members. 
   [B] Jimmy Hoffa used to work as a civil servant. 
   [C] unions have enlarged their public-sector membership. 
   [D]the government has improved its relationship with unionists. 
   37. Which of the following is true of Paragraph 2? 
   [A] Public-sector unions are prudent in taking actions. 
   [B] Education is required for public-sector union membership. 
   [C] Labor Party has long been fighting against public-sector unions. 
   [D]Public-sector unions seldom get in trouble for their actions. 
   38. It can be learned from Paragraph 4 that the income in the state 
sector is 
   [A] illegally secured. 
   [B] indirectly augmented. 
   [C] excessively increased. 
   [D]fairly adjusted. 
   39. The example of the unions in Wisconsin shows that unions 
   [A]often run against the current political system. 
   [B]can change people‘s political attitudes. 
   [C]may be a barrier to public-sector reforms. 
   [D]are dominant in the government. 
   40. John Donahue‘s attitude towards the public-sector system is one 
of

   [A]disapproval.

   Think of those fleeting moments when you look out of an aeroplane 
window and realise that you are flying, higher than a bird. Now think of 
your laptop, thinner than a brown-paper envelope, or your cellphone in 
the palm of your hand. Take a moment or two to wonder at those marvels. 
You are the lucky inheritor of a dream come true. 
   The second half of the 20th century saw a collection of geniuses, 
warriors, entrepreneurs and visionaries labour to create a fabulous 
machine that could function as a typewriter and printing press, studio 
and theatre, paintbrush and gallery, piano and radio, the mail as well 
as the mail carrier. (41) 
   The networked computer is an amazing device, the first media machine 
that serves as the mode of production, means of distribution, site of 
reception, and place of praise and critique. The computer is the 21st 
century's culture machine. 
   But for all the reasons there are to celebrate the computer, we must 
also tread with caution. (42)I call it a secret war for two reasons. 
First, most people do not realise that there are strong commercial 
agendas at work to keep them in passive consumption mode. Second, the 
majority of people who use networked computers to upload are not even 
aware of the significance of what they are doing. 
   All animals download, but only a few upload. Beavers build dams and 
birds make nests. Yet for the most part, the animal kingdom moves 
through the world downloading. Humans are unique in their capacity to 
not only make tools but then turn around and use them to create 
superfluous material goods - paintings, sculpture and architecture - and 
superfluous experiences - music, literature, religion and philosophy. 
(43) 
   For all the possibilities of our new culture machines, most people 
are still stuck in download mode. Even after the advent of widespread 
social media, a pyramid of production remains, with a small number of 
people uploading material, a slightly larger group commenting on or 
modifying that content, and a huge percentage remaining content to just 
consume. (44) 
   Television is a one-way tap flowing into our homes. The hardest task 
that television asks of anyone is to turn the power off after he has 
turned it on. 
   (45) 
   What counts as meaningful uploading? My definition revolves around 
the concept of "stickiness" - creations and experiences to which others 
adhere. 
   [A] Of course, it is precisely these superfluous things that define 
human culture and ultimately what it is to 
   - 68 - 
   be human. Downloading and consuming culture requires great skills, 
but failing to move beyond downloading is to strip oneself of a defining 
constituent of humanity. 
   [B] Applications like tumblr.com, which allow users to combine 
pictures, words and other media in creative ways and then share them, 
have the potential to add stickiness by amusing, entertaining and 
enlightening others. 
   [C] Not only did they develop such a device but by the turn of the 
millennium they had also managed to embed it in a worldwide system 
accessed by billions of people every day. 
   [D] This is because the networked computer has sparked a secret war 
between downloading and uploading - between passive consumption and 
active creation - whose outcome will shape our collective future in ways 
we can only begin to imagine. 
   [E] The challenge the computer mounts to television thus bears 
little similarity to one format being replaced by another in the manner 
of record players being replaced by CD players. 
   [F] One reason for the persistence of this pyramid of production is 
that for the past half-century, much of the world's media culture has 
been defined by a single medium - television - and television is defined 
by downloading. 
   [G]The networked computer offers the first chance in 50 years to 
reverse the flow, to encourage thoughtful downloading and, even more 
importantly, meaningful uploading.

   Since the days of Aristotle, a search for universal principles has 
characterized the scientific enterprise. In some ways, this quest for 
commonalities defines science. Newton‘s laws of motion and Darwinian 
evolution each bind 
   a host of different phenomena into a single explicatory frame work. 
   (46)In physics, one approach takes this impulse for unification to 
its extreme, and seeks a theory of everything―a single generative 
equation for all we see.It is becoming less clear, however, that such a 
theory 
   would be a simplification, given the dimensions and universes that 
it might entail, nonetheless, unification of sorts remains a major goal. 
   This tendency in the natural sciences has long been evident in the 
social sciences too. (47)Here, Darwinism 
   seems to offer justification for it all humans share common origins 
it seems reasonable to suppose that cultural diversity could also be 
traced to more constrained beginnings. Just as the bewildering variety 
of human courtship 
   rituals might all be considered forms of sexual selection, perhaps 
the world‘s languages, music, social and religious customs and even 
history are governed by universal features. (48)To filter out what is 
unique from what 
   is shared might enable us to understand how complex cultural 
behavior arose and what guides it in evolutionary or cognitive terms. 
   That, at least, is the hope. But a comparative study of linguistic 
traits published online today supplies a reality check. Russell Gray at 
the University of Auckland and his colleagues consider the evolution of 
grammars in the light of two previous attempts to find universality in 
language. 
   The most famous of these efforts was initiated by Noam Chomsky, who 
suggested that humans are born with an innate language―acquisition 
capacity that dictates a universal grammar. A few generative rules are 
then sufficient to unfold the entire fundamental structure of a language, 
which is why children can learn it so quickly. 
   - 69 - 
   (49)The second, by Joshua Greenberg, takes a more empirical approach 
to universality identifying traits (particularly in word order) shared 
by many language which are considered to represent biases that result 
from cognitive constraints 
   Gray and his colleagues have put them to the test by examining four 
family trees that between them represent more than 2,000 
languages.(50)Chomsky‘s grammar should show patterns of language change 
that are 
   independent of the family tree or the pathway tracked through it. 
Whereas Greenbergian universality predicts strong co-dependencies 
between particular types of word-order relations. Neither of these 
patterns is borne out by 
   the analysis, suggesting that the structures of the languages are 
lire age-specific and not governed by universals [NxtPage]

   The decision of the New York Philharmonic to hire Alan Gilbert as 
its next music director has been the talk of the classical-music world 
ever since the sudden announcement of his appointment in 2009. For the 
most part, the response has been favorable, to say the least. DHooray! 
At last!‖ wrote Anthony Tommasini, a sober-sided classical-music critic. 
   One of the reasons why the appointment came as such a surprise, 
however, is that Gilbert is comparatively little known. Even Tommasini, 
who had advocated Gilbert‘s appointment in the Times, calls him Dan 
unpretentious musician with no air of the formidable conductor about 
him.‖ As a description of the next music director of an orchestra that 
has hitherto been led by musicians like Gustav Mahler and Pierre Boulez, 
that seems likely to have struck at least some Times readers as faint 
praise. 
   For my part, I have no idea whether Gilbert is a great conductor or 
even a good one. To be sure, he performs an impressive variety of 
interesting compositions, but it is not necessary for me to visit Avery 
Fisher Hall, or anywhere else, to hear interesting orchestral music. All 
I have to do is to go to my CD shelf, or boot up my computer and 
download still more recorded music from iTunes. 
   Devoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for 
live performance are missing the point. For the time, attention, and 
money of the art-loving public, classical instrumentalists must compete 
not only with opera houses, dance troupes, theater companies, and 
museums, but also with the recorded performances of the great classical 
musicians of the 20th century. There recordings are cheap, available 
everywhere, and very often much higher in artistic quality than today‘s 
live performances; moreover, they can be Dconsumed‖ at a time and 
place of the listener‘s choosing. The widespread availability of such 
recordings 
   has thus brought about a crisis in the institution of the 
traditional classical concert. 
   One possible response is for classical performers to program 
attractive new music that is not yet available on record. Gilbert‘s own 
interest in new music has been widely noted: Alex Ross, a classical-
music critic, has 
   described him as a man who is capable of turning the Philharmonic 
into Da markedly different, more vibrant organization.‖ But what will 
be the nature of that difference? Merely expanding the orchestra‘s 
repertoire will not be enough. If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to 
succeed, they must first change the relationship between America‘s 
oldest orchestra and the new audience it hops to attract. 
   21. We learn from Para.1 that Gilbert‘s appointment has 
   [A]incurred criticism. [B]raised suspicion. [C]received acclaim. 
[D]aroused curiosity. 22. Tommasini regards Gilbert as an artist who is 
   [A]influential. [B]modest. [C]respectable. [D]talented. 
   23. The author believes that the devoted concertgoers 
   [A]ignore the expenses of live performances. [B]reject most kinds of 
recorded performances. [C]exaggerate the variety of live performances. 
[D]overestimate the value of live performances. 24. According to the 
text, which of the following is true of recordings? 
   [A]They are often inferior to live concerts in quality. 
   [B]They are easily accessible to the general public. 
   [C]They help improve the quality of music. [D]They have only covered 
masterpieces. 
   25. Regarding Gilbert‘s role in revitalizing the Philharmonic, the 
author feels

   [A]doubtful. [B]enthusiastic. [C]confident. [D]puzzled.

   When Liam McGee departed as president of Bank of America in August, 
his explanation was surprisingly straight up. Rather than cloaking his 
exit in the usual vague excuses, he came right out and said he was 
leaving Dto pursue my goal of running a company.‖ Broadcasting his 
ambition was Dvery much my decision,‖ McGee says. Within two weeks, he 
was talking for the first time with the board of Hartford Financial 
Services Group, which named him CEO and chairman on September 29. 
   McGee says leaving without a position lined up gave him time to 
reflect on what kind of company he wanted to run. It also sent a clear 
message to the outside world about his aspirations. And McGee isn‘t 
alone. 
   In recent weeks the No.2 executives at Avon and American Express 
quit with the explanation that they were looking for a CEO post. As 
boards scrutinize succession plans in response to shareholder pressure, 
executives who don‘t get the nod also may wish to move on. A turbulent 
business environment also has senior managers cautious of letting vague 
pronouncements cloud their reputations. 
   As the first signs of recovery begin to take hold, deputy chiefs may 
be more willing to make the jump without a net. In the third quarter, 
CEO turnover was down 23% from a year ago as nervous boards stuck with 
the leaders they had, according to Liberum Research. As the economy 
picks up, opportunities will abound for aspiring leaders. 
   The decision to quit a senior position to look for a better one is 
unconventional. For years executives and headhunters have adhered to the 
rule that the most attractive CEO candidates are the ones who must be 
poached. Says Korn/Ferry senior partner Dennis Carey:‖I can‘t think of 
a single search I‘ve done where a board has not instructed me to look 
at sitting CEOs first.‖ 
   Those who jumped without a job haven‘t always landed in top 
positions quickly. Ellen Marram quit as chief of Tropicana a decade age, 
saying she wanted to be a CEO. It was a year before she became head of a 
tiny Internet-based commodities exchange. Robert Willumstad left 
Citigroup in 2005 with ambitions to be a CEO. He finally took that post 
at a major financial institution three years later. 
   Many recruiters say the old disgrace is fading for top performers. 
The financial crisis has made it more acceptable to be between jobs or 
to leave a bad one. DThe traditional rule was it‘s safer to stay where 
you are, but that‘s been fundamentally inverted,‖ says one 
headhunter. DThe people who‘ve been hurt the worst are those who‘ve 
stayed too long.‖ 
   26. When McGee announced his departure, his manner can best be 
described as being

   The rough guide to marketing success used to be that you got what 
you paid for. No longer. While traditional Dpaid‖ media C such as 
television commercials and print advertisements C still play a major 
role, 
   companies today can exploit many alternative forms of media. 
Consumers passionate about a product may create Downed‖ media by 
sending e-mail alerts about products and sales to customers registered 
with its Web site. The way consumers now approach the broad range of 
factors beyond conventional paid media. 
   Paid and owned media are controlled by marketers promoting their own 
products. For earned media , such marketers act as the initiator for 
users‘ responses. But in some cases, one marketer‘s owned media 
   become another marketer‘s paid media C for instance, when an e-
commerce retailer sells ad space on its Web 
   site. We define such sold media as owned media whose traffic is so 
strong that other organizations place their content or e-commerce 
engines within that environment. This trend ,which we believe is still 
in its infancy, effectively began with retailers and travel providers 
such as airlines and hotels and will no doubt go further. Johnson & 
Johnson, for example, has created BabyCenter, a stand-alone media 
property that promotes complementary and even competitive products. 
Besides generating income, the presence of other marketers makes the 
site seem objective, gives companies opportunities to learn valuable 
information about the appeal of other companies‘ marketing, and may 
help expand user traffic for all companies concerned. 
   The same dramatic technological changes that have provided marketers 
with more (and more diverse) communications choices have also increased 
the risk that passionate consumers will voice their opinions in quicker, 
more visible, and much more damaging ways. Such hijacked media are the 
opposite of earned media: an asset or campaign becomes hostage to 
consumers, other stakeholders, or activists who make negative 
allegations about a brand or product. Members of social networks, for 
instance, are learning that they can hijack media to apply pressure on 
the businesses that originally created them. 
   If that happens, passionate consumers would try to persuade others 
to boycott products, putting the reputation of the target company at 
risk. In such a case, the company‘s response may not be sufficiently 
quick or thoughtful, and the learning curve has been steep. Toyota Motor, 
for example, alleviated some of the damage from its recall crisis 
earlier this year with a relatively quick and well-orchestrated social-
media response campaign, which included efforts to engage with consumers 
directly on sites such as Twitter and the social-news site Digg. 
   31.Consumers may create Dearned‖ media when they are 
   [A] obscssed with online shopping at certain Web sites. 
   [B] inspired by product-promoting e-mails sent to them. 
   [C] eager to help their friends promote quality products. 
   [D] enthusiastic about recommending their favorite products.

   It‘s no surprise that Jennifer Senior‘s insightful, provocative 
magazine cover story, DI love My Children, I Hate My Life,‖ is 
arousing much chatter C nothing gets people talking like the suggestion 
that child rearing is anything less than a completely fulfilling, life-
enriching experience. Rather than concluding that children make parents 
either happy or miserable, Senior suggests we need to redefine happiness: 
instead of thinking of it as something that can be measured by moment-
to-moment joy, we should consider being happy as a past-tense condition. 
Even though the day-to-day experience of raising kids can be soul-
crushingly hard, Senior writes that Dthe very things that in the moment 
dampen our moods can later be sources of intense gratification and 
delight.‖ 
   The magazine cover showing an attractive mother holding a cute baby 
is hardly the only Madonna-and-child image on newsstands this week. 
There are also stories about newly adoptive C and newly 
   single C mom Sandra Bullock, as well as the usual DJennifer 
Aniston is pregnant‖ news. Practically every week features at least one 
celebrity mom, or mom-to-be, smiling on the newsstands. 
   In a society that so persistently celebrates procreation, is it any 
wonder that admitting you regret having children is equivalent to 
admitting you support kitten-killing ? It doesn‘t seem quite fair, then, 
to compare the 
   regrets of parents to the regrets of the children. Unhappy parents 
rarely are provoked to wonder if they shouldn‘t have had kids, but 
unhappy childless folks are bothered with the message that children are 
the single most important thing in the world: obviously their misery 
must be a direct result of the gaping baby-size holes in their lives. 
   Of course, the image of parenthood that celebrity magazines like Us 
Weekly and People present is hugely unrealistic, especially when the 
parents are single mothers like Bullock. According to several studies 
concluding that parents are less happy than childless couples, single 
parents are the least happy of all. No shock there, considering how much 
work it is to raise a kid without a partner to lean on; yet to hear 
Sandra and Britney tell it, raising a kid on their Down‖ (read: with 
round-the-clock help) is a piece of cake. 
   It‘s hard to imagine that many people are dumb enough to want 
children just because Reese and Angelina make it look so glamorous: most 
adults understand that a baby is not a haircut. But it‘s interesting to 
wonder if 
   the images we see every week of stress-free, happiness-enhancing 
parenthood aren‘t in some small, 
   subconscious way contributing to our own dissatisfactions with the 
actual experience, in the same way that a small part of us hoped 
getting D the Rachel‖ might make us look just a little bit like 
Jennifer Aniston.

bring 
   [A]temporary delight [B]enjoyment in progress

   [A] No disciplines have seized on professionalism with as much 
enthusiasm as the humanities. You can, Mr Menand points out, became a 
lawyer in three years and a medical doctor in four. But the regular time 
it takes to get a doctoral degree in the humanities is nine years. Not 
surprisingly, up to half of all doctoral students in English drop out 
before getting their degrees. 
   [B] His concern is mainly with the humanities: Literature, languages, 
philosophy and so on. These are disciplines that are going out of style: 
22% of American college graduates now major in business compared with 
only 2% in history and 4% in English. However, many leading American 
universities want their undergraduates to have a grounding in the basic 
canon of ideas that every educated person should posses. But most find 
it difficult to agree on what a Dgeneral education‖ should look like. 
At Harvard, Mr Menand notes, Dthe great books are read because they 
have been read‖-they form a sort of social glue. 
   [C] Equally unsurprisingly, only about half end up with 
professorships for which they entered graduate school. There are simply 
too few posts. This is partly because universities continue to produce 
ever more PhDs. But fewer students want to study humanities subjects: 
English departments awarded more bachelor‘s degrees in 1970-71 than 
they did 20 years later. Fewer students requires fewer teachers. So, at 
the end of a decade of theses-writing, many humanities students leave 
the profession to do something for which they have not been trained. 
   [D] One reason why it is hard to design and teach such courses is 
that they can cut across the insistence by top American universities 
that liberal-arts educations and professional education should be kept 
separate, taught in different schools. Many students experience both 
varieties. Although more than half of Harvard undergraduates end up in 
law, medicine or business, future doctors and lawyers must study a non-
specialist liberal-arts degree before embarking on a professional 
qualification. 
   [E] Besides professionalizing the professions by this separation, 
top American universities have professionalised the professor. The 
growth in public money for academic research has speeded the process: 
federal research grants rose fourfold between 1960and 1990, but faculty 
teaching hours fell by half as research took its toll. Professionalism 
has turned the acquisition of a doctoral degree into a prerequisite for 
a successful academic career: as late as 1969a third of American 
professors did not possess one. But the key idea behind 
professionalisation, argues Mr Menand, is that Dthe knowledge and 
skills needed for a particular specialization are transmissible but not 
transferable.‖So disciplines acquire a monopoly not just over the 
production of 
   knowledge, but also over the production of the producers of 
knowledge. 
   [F] The key to reforming higher education, concludes Mr Menand, is 
to alter the way in which Dthe producers of knowledge are 
produced.‖Otherwise, academics will continue to think dangerously alike, 
   increasingly detached from the societies which they study, 
investigate and criticize.‖Academic inquiry, at least in some fields, 
may need to become less exclusionary and more holistic.‖Yet quite how 
that happens, Mr Menand dose not say.

   [G] The subtle and intelligent little book The Marketplace of Ideas: 
Reform and Resistance in the American University should be read by every 
student thinking of applying to take a doctoral degree. They may then

American Universities, and Louis Menand, a professor of English at 
Harvard University, captured it skillfully.

   With its theme that DMind is the master weaver,‖ creating our 
inner character and outer circumstances, the book As a Man Thinking by 
James Allen is an in-depth exploration of the central idea of self-help 
writing. 
   (46) Allen‘s contribution was to take an assumption we all share-
that because we are not robots we 
   therefore control our thoughts-and reveal its erroneous nature. 
Because most of us believe that mind is separate from matter, we think 
that thoughts can be hidden and made powerless; this allows us to think 
one way and act another. However, Allen believed that the unconscious 
mind generates as much action as the conscious mind, and (47) while we 
may be able to sustain the illusion of control through the conscious 
mind alone, in reality we are continually faced with a question: DWhy 
cannot I make myself do this or achieve that? ‖ 
   Since desire and will are damaged by the presence of thoughts that 
do not accord with desire, Allen concluded : D We do not attract what 
we want, but what we are.‖ Achievement happens because you as a person 
embody the external achievement; you don‘t D get‖ success but become 
it. There is no gap between mind and matter. 
   Part of the fame of Allen‘s book is its contention 
that DCircumstances do not make a person, they reveal him.‖ (48) This 
seems a justification for neglect of those in need, and a 
rationalization of exploitation, of the superiority of those at the top 
and the inferiority of those at the bottom. 
   This ,however, would be a knee-jerk reaction to a subtle argument. 
Each set of circumstances, however bad, offers a unique opportunity for 
growth. If circumstances always determined the life and prospects of 
people, then humanity would never have progressed. In fat, 
(49)circumstances seem to be designed to bring out the best in us and if 
we feel that we have been Dwronged‖ then we are unlikely to begin a 
conscious effort to escape from our situation .Nevertheless, as any 
biographer knows, a person‘s early life and its conditions are often 
the greatest gift to an individual. 
   The sobering aspect of Allen‘s book is that we have no one else to 
blame for our present condition except ourselves. (50) The upside is the 
possibilities contained in knowing that everything is up to us; where 
before we were experts in the array of limitations, now we become 
authorities of what is possible. Section ? Writing

   In 1924 America's National Research Council sent two engineers to 
supervise a series of industrial experiments at a large telephone-parts 
factory called the Hawthorne Plant near Chicago. It hoped they would 
learn how stop-floor lighting 1 workers' productivity. Instead, the 
   studies ended 2 giving their name to the "Hawthorne effect", the 
extremely influential idea that the very 3 to being experimented upon 
changed subjects' behavior. 
   The idea arose because of the 4 behavior of the women in the 
Hawthorne plant. 
   According to 5 of the experiments, their hourly output rose when

   Of all the changes that have taken place in English-language 
newspapers during the past quarter-century, perhaps the most far-
reaching has been the inexorable decline in the scope and seriousness of 
their arts coverage. 
   It is difficult to the point of impossibility for the average reader 
under the age of forty to imagine a time when high-quality arts 
criticism could be found in most big-city newspapers. Yet 
   tha considerable number of the most significant collections of 
criticism published in the 20 
   century consisted in large part of newspaper reviews. To read such 
books today is to marvel at the fact that their learned contents were 
once deemed suitable for publication in general-circulation dailies. 
   We are even farther removed from the unfocused newspaper reviews 
published in England 
   thbetween the turn of the 20 century and the eve of World War II, at 
a time when newsprint was dirt-cheap and stylish arts criticism was 
considered an ornament to the publications in which it appeared. In 
those far-off days, it was taken for granted that the critics of major 
papers would write in detail and at length about the events they covered. 
Theirs was a serious business, and even those reviewers who wore their 
learning lightly, like George Bernard Shaw and Ernest Newman, could be 
trusted to know what they were about. These men believed in journalism 
as a calling, and were proud to be published in the daily press. DSo 
few authors have brains enough or 
   literary gift enough to keep their own end up in journalism,‖ 
Newman wrote, Dthat I am tempted to define ?journalism‘ as ?a term of 
contempt applied by writers who are not read to writers who are.‘‖ 
   Unfortunately, these critics are virtually forgotten. Neville Cardus, 
who wrote for the Manchester Guardian from 1917 until shortly before his 
death in 1975, is now known solely as a writer of essays on the game of 
cricket. During his lifetime, though, he was also one of England‘s 
foremost classical-music critics, a stylist so widely admired that his 
Autobiography (1947) 
   became a best-seller. He was knighted in 1967, the first music 
critic to be so honored. Yet only one of his books is now in print, and 
his vast body of writings on music is unknown save to specialists. 
   Is there any chance that Cardus‘s criticism will enjoy a revival? 
The prospect seems remote. Journalistic tastes had changed long before 
his death, and postmodern readers have little use for the richly 
upholstered Vicwardian prose in which he specialized. Moreover, the 
amateur tradition in music criticism has been in headlong retreat. 
   81 
   21. It is indicated in Paragraphs 1 and 2 that 
   [A] arts criticism has disappeared from big-city newspapers. 
   [B] English-language newspapers used to carry more arts reviews. 
   [C] high-quality newspapers retain a large body of readers.

   Over the past decade, thousands of patents have been granted for 
what are called business methods. Amazon.com received one for its "one-
click" online payment system. Merrill Lynch got legal protection for an 
asset allocation strategy. One inventor patented a technique for lifting 
a 
   box. 
   Now the nation's top patent court appears completely ready to scale 
back on business-method patents, which have been controversial ever 
since they were first authorized 10 years ago. In a move that has 
intellectual-property lawyers abuzz the U.S. court of Appeals for the 
federal circuit said it would use a particular case to conduct a broad 
review of 
   82 
   business-method patents. In re Bilski, as the case is known , is "a 
very big deal", says Dennis D. 
   Crouch of the University of Missouri School of law. It "has the 
potential to eliminate an entire class of patents." 
   Curbs on business-method claims would be a dramatic about-face, 
because it was the federal circuit itself that introduced such patents 
with its 1998 decision in the so-called state Street Bank case, 
approving a patent on a way of pooling mutual-fund assets. That ruling 
produced an explosion in business-method patent filings, initially by 
emerging internet companies trying to stake out exclusive rights to 
specific types of online transactions. Later, more established companies 
raced to add such patents to their files, if only as a defensive move 
against rivals that might beat them to the punch. In 2005, IBM noted in 
a court filing that it had been issued more than 300 business-method 
patents despite the fact that it questioned the legal basis for granting 
them. Similarly, some Wall Street investment films armed themselves with 
patents for financial products, even as they took positions in court 
cases opposing the practice. 
   The Bilski case involves a claimed patent on a method for hedging 
risk in the energy market. The Federal circuit issued an unusual order 
stating that the case would be heard by all 12 of the court's judges, 
rather than a typical panel of three, and that one issue it wants to 
evaluate is whether it should "reconsider" its state street Bank ruling. 
   The Federal Circuit's action comes in the wake of a series of recent 
decisions by the supreme Court that has narrowed the scope of 
protections for patent holders. Last April, for example the justices 
signaled that too many patents were being upheld for "inventions" that 
are obvious. The judges on the Federal circuit are "reacting to the 
anti-patent trend at the Supreme Court", says Harold C. Wegner, a patent 
attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School. 
   26. Business-method patents have recently aroused concern because of 
   [A] their limited value to business 
   [B] their connection with asset allocation 
   [C] the possible restriction on their granting 
   [D] the controversy over their authorization 
   27. Which of the following is true of the Bilski case?

   [B] It involves a very big business transaction 
   [C] It has been dismissed by the Federal Circuit 
   [D] It may change the legal practices in the U.S. 
   28. The word "about-face" (Line 1, Para 3) most probably means 
   [A] loss of good will 
   [B] increase of hostility 
   [C] change of attitude 
   [D] enhancement of dignity

   [A] are immune to legal challenges 
   [B] are often unnecessarily issued 
   [C] lower the esteem for patent holders 
   [D] increase the incidence of risks

   In his book The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell argues that social 
epidemics are driven in large part by the acting of a tiny minority of 
special individuals, often called influentials, who are unusually 
informed, persuasive, or well-connected. The idea is intuitively 
compelling, but it doesn't explain how ideas actually spread. 
   The supposed importance of influentials derives from a plausible 
sounding but largely untested theory called the "two step flow of 
communication": Information flows from the media to the influentials and 
from them to everyone else. Marketers have embraced the two-step flow 
because it suggests that if they can just find and influence the 
influentials, those selected people will do most of the work for them. 
The theory also seems to explain the sudden and unexpected popularity of 
certain looks, brands, or neighborhoods. In many such cases, a cursory 
search for causes finds that some small group of people was wearing, 
promoting, or developing whatever it is before anyone else paid 
attention. Anecdotal evidence of this kind fits nicely with the idea 
that only certain special people can drive trends 
   In their recent work, however, some researchers have come up with 
the finding that influentials have far less impact on social epidemics 
than is generally supposed. In fact, they don't seem to be required of 
all. 
   The researchers' argument stems from a simple observing about social 
influence, with the exception of a few celebrities like Oprah Winfrey―
whose outsize presence is primarily a 
   function of media, not interpersonal, influence―even the most 
influential members of a 
   population simply don't interact with that many others. Yet it is 
precisely these non-celebrity influentials who, according to the two-
step-flow theory, are supposed to drive social epidemics by influencing 
their friends and colleagues directly. For a social epidemic to occur, 
however, each person so affected, must then influence his or her own 
acquaintances, who must in turn influence theirs, and so on; and just 
how many others pay attention to each of these people has little to do 
with the initial influential. If people in the network just two degrees 
removed from the initial influential prove resistant, for example, the 
cascade of change won't propagate very far or affect many people. 
   Building on the basic truth about interpersonal influence, the 
researchers studied the 
   84 
   dynamics of populations manipulating a number of variables relating 
of populations, manipulating a number of variables relating to people's 
ability to influence others and their tendency to be influenced. Our 
work shows that the principal requirement for what we call "global 
cascades" C the widespread propagation of influence through networks C

   Bankers have been blaming themselves for their troubles in public. 
Behind the scenes, they have been taking aim at someone else: the 
accounting standard-setters. Their rules, moan the 
   85 
   banks, have forced them to report enormous losses, and it's just not 
fair. These rules say they must value some assets at the price a third 
party would pay, not the price managers and regulators would like them 
to fetch. 
   Unfortunately, banks' lobbying now seems to be working. The details 
may be unknowable, but the independence of standard-setters, essential 
to the proper functioning of capital markets, is being compromised. And, 
unless banks carry toxic assets at prices that attract buyers, reviving 
the banking system will be difficult. 
   After a bruising encounter with Congress, America's Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rushed through rule changes. These 
gave banks more freedom to use models to value illiquid assets and more 
flexibility in recognizing losses on long-term assets in their income 
statement. Bob Herz, the FASB's chairman, cried out against those who 
"question our motives." Yet bank shares rose and the changes enhance 
what one lobby group politely calls "the use of judgment by management." 
   European ministers instantly demanded that the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) do likewise. The IASB says it does not 
want to act without overall planning, but the pressure to fold when it 
completes it reconstruction of rules later this year is strong. Charlie 
McCreevy, a European commissioner, warned the IASB that it did "not live 
in a political vacuum" but "in the real word" and that Europe could yet 
develop different rules. 
   It was banks that were on the wrong planet, with accounts that 
vastly overvalued assets. Today they argue that market prices overstate 
losses, because they largely reflect the temporary illiquidity of 
markets, not the likely extent of bad debts. The truth will not be known 
for years. But bank's shares trade below their book value, suggesting 
that investors are skeptical. And dead markets partly reflect the 
paralysis of banks which will not sell assets for fear of booking losses, 
yet are reluctant to buy all those supposed bargains. 
   To get the system working again, losses must be recognized and dealt 
with. America's new plan to buy up toxic assets will not work unless 
banks mark assets to levels which buyers find attractive. Successful 
markets require independent and even combative standard-setters. The 
FASB and IASB have been exactly that, cleaning up rules on stock options 
and pensions, for example, against hostility from special interests. But 
by giving in to critics now they are inviting pressure to make more 
concessions. 
   36. Bankers complained that they were forced to 
   [A] follow unfavorable asset evaluation rules 
   [B] collect payments from third parties 
   [C] cooperate with the price managers 
   [D] reevaluate some of their assets.

result in 
   [A] the diminishing role of management

   [A] The first and more important is the consumer's growing 
preference for eating out; the consumption of food and drink in places 
other than homes has risen from about 32 percent of total consumption in 
1995 to 35 percent in 2000 and is expected to approach 38 percent by 
2005. This development is boosting wholesale demand from the food 
service segment by 4 to 5 percent a year across Europe, compared with 
growth in retail demand of 1 to 2 percent. Meanwhile, as the recession 
is looming large, people are getting anxious. They tend to keep a 
tighter hold on their purse and consider eating at home a realistic 
alternative. 
   [B] Retail sales of food and drink in Europe's largest markets are 
at a standstill, leaving European grocery retailers hungry for 
opportunities to grow. Most leading retailers have already tried e-
commerce, with limited success, and expansion abroad. But almost all 
have ignored the big, profitable opportunity in their own backyard: the 
wholesale food and drink trade, which appears to be just the kind of 
market retailers need. 
   87 
   [C] Will such variations bring about a change in the overall 
structure of the food and drink market? Definitely not. The functioning 
of the market is based on flexible trends dominated by potential buyers. 
In other words, it is up to the buyer, rather than the seller, to decide 
what to buy .At any rate, this change will ultimately be acclaimed by an 
ever-growing number of both domestic and international consumers, 
regardless of how long the current consumer pattern will take hold. 
   [D] All in all, this clearly seems to be a market in which big 
retailers could profitably apply their scale, existing infrastructure 
and proven skills in the management of product ranges, logistics, and 
marketing intelligence. Retailers that master the intricacies of 
wholesaling in Europe may well expect to rake in substantial profits 
thereby. At least, that is how it looks as a whole. Closer inspection 
reveals important differences among the biggest national markets, 
especially in their customer segments and wholesale structures, as well 
as the competitive dynamics of individual food and drink categories. Big 
retailers must understand these differences before they can identify the 
segments of European wholesaling in which their particular abilities 
might unseat smaller but entrenched competitors. New skills and 
unfamiliar business models are needed too. 
   [E] Despite variations in detail, wholesale markets in the countries 
that have been closely examined―France, Germany, Italy, and Spain―are 
made out of the same building blocks. 
   Demand comes mainly from two sources: independent mom-and-pop 
grocery stores which, unlike large retail chains, are too small to buy 
straight from producers, and food service operators that cater to 
consumers when they don't eat at home. Such food service operators range 
from snack machines to large institutional catering ventures, but most 
of these businesses are known in the trade as "horeca": hotels, 
restaurants, and cafes. Overall, Europe's wholesale market for food and 
drink is growing at the same sluggish pace as the retail market, but the 
figures, when added together, mask two opposing trends. 
   [F] For example, wholesale food and drink sales come to $268 billion 
in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom in 2000―more 
than 40 percent of retail sales. Moreover, 
   average overall margins are higher in wholesale than in retail; 
wholesale demand from the food service sector is growing quickly as more 
Europeans eat out more often; and changes in the competitive dynamics of 
this fragmented industry are at last making it feasible for wholesalers 
to consolidate. 
   [G] However, none of these requirements should deter large retailers 
(and even some large good producers and existing wholesalers) from 
trying their hand, for those that master the intricacies of wholesaling 
in Europe stand to reap considerable gains.

   One basic weakness in a conservation system based wholly on economic 
motives is that most members of the land community have no economic 
value. Yet these creatures are members of the biotic community and, if 
its stability depends on its integrity, they are entitled to continuance. 
   When one of these noneconomic categories is threatened and, if we 
happen to love it .We invert excuses to give it economic importance. At 
the beginning of century songbirds were supposed to be disappearing. (46) 
Scientists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence to 
the effect that insects would eat us up if birds failed to control them. 
the evidence 
   had to be economic in order to be valid. 
   It is painful to read these round about accounts today. We have no 
land ethic yet, (47) but we have at least drawn near the point of 
admitting that birds should continue as a matter of intrinsic right, 
regardless of the presence or absence of economic advantage to us. 
   A parallel situation exists in respect of predatory mammals and 
fish-eating birds. (48) Time was when biologists somewhat over worded 
the evidence that these creatures preserve the health of game by killing 
the physically weak, or that they prey only on "worthless" species. 
   Some species of tree have been read out of the party by economics-
minded foresters because they grow too slowly, or have too low a sale 
vale to pay as timber crops. (49) In Europe, where forestry is 
ecologically more advanced, the non-commercial tree species are 
recognized as members of native forest community, to be preserved as 
such, within reason. 
   To sum up: a system of conservation based solely on economic self-
interest is hopelessly lopsided. (50) It tends to ignore, and thus 
eventually to eliminate, many elements in the land community that lack 
commercial value, but that are essential to its healthy functioning. It 
   assumes, falsely, I think, that the economic parts of the biotic 
clock will function without the uneconomic parts.

   Habits are a funny thing. We reach for them mindlessly, setting our 
brains on auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of 
familiar routine. "Not choice, but habit rules the unreflecting herd," 
William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. In the ever-changing 21st 
century, even the word "habit" carries a negative implication. 
   So it seems paradoxical to talk about habits in the same context as 
creativity and innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that 
when we consciously develop new habits, we create parallel paths, and 
even entirely new brain cells, that can jump our trains of thought onto 
new, innovative tracks. 
   Rather than dismissing ourselves as unchangeable creatures of habit, 
we can instead direct our own change by consciously developing new 
habits. In fact, the more new things we try―the 
   more we step outside our comfort zone―the more inherently creative 
we become, both in the 
   workplace and in our personal lives. 
   But don't bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of 
procedure are worn into the 
   hippocampus, they're there to stay. Instead, the new habits we 
deliberately ingrain into ourselves create parallel pathways that can 
bypass those old roads. 
   "The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with 
wonder," says Dawna Markova, author of "The Open Mind" and an executive 
change consultant for Professional Thinking Partners. "But we are taught 
instead to 'decide,' just as our president calls himself 'the Decider.' 
" She adds, however, that "to decide is to kill off all possibilities 
but one. A good innovational thinker is always exploring the many other 
possibilities." 
   All of us work through problems in ways of which we're unaware, she 
says. Researchers in the late 1960s discovered that humans are born with 
the capacity to approach challenges in four primary ways: analytically, 
procedurally, relationally (or collaboratively) and innovatively. At the 
end of adolescence, however, the brain shuts down half of that capacity, 
preserving only those modes of thought that have seemed most valuable 
during the first decade or so of life. 
   The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and 
procedure, meaning that few of us inherently use our innovative and 
collaborative modes of thought. "This breaks the major rule in the 
American belief system ― that anyone can do anything," explains M. J. 
Ryan, 
   author of the 2006 book This Year I Will... and Ms. Markova's 
business partner. "That's a lie that 
   we have perpetuated, and it fosters commonness. Knowing what you're 
good at and doing even more of it creates excellence." This is where 
developing new habits comes in.

   It is a wise father that knows his own child, but today a man can 
boost his paternal (fatherly) wisdom C or at least confirm that he's 
the kid's dad. All he needs to do is shell our $30 for paternity testing 
kit (PTK) at his local drugstore C and another $120 to get the results. 
   More than 60,000 people have purchased the PTKs since they first 
become available without prescriptions last years, according to Doug Fog, 
chief operating officer of Identigene, which makes the over-the-counter 
kits. More than two dozen companies sell DNA tests Directly to the 
public , ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to more than $2,500. 
   Among the most popular: paternity and kinship testing , which 
adopted children can use to find their biological relatives and families 
can use to track down kids put up for adoption. DNA testing is also the 
latest rage among passionate genealogists―and supports businesses that 
offer 
   to search for a family's geographic roots . 
   Most tests require collecting cells by swabbing saliva in the mouth 
and sending it to the company for testing. All tests require a potential 
candidate with whom to compare DNA. 
   But some observers are skeptical, "There is a kind of false 
precision being hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry 
testing," says Trey Duster, a New York University sociologist. He notes 
that each individual has many ancestors-numbering in the hundreds just a 
few centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only considers a single 
lineage, either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a father's 
line or mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down only from mothers. This 
DNA can reveal genetic information about only one or two 
   94 
   ancestors, even though, for example, just three generations back 
people also have six other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 
14 other great-great-grandparents. 
   Critics also argue that commercial genetic testing is only as good 
as the reference collections to which a sample is compared. Databases 
used by some companies don't rely on data collected systematically but 
rather lump together information from different research projects. This 
means that a DNA database may have a lot of data from some regions and 
not others, so a person‘s test results may differ depending on the 
company that processes the results. In addition, the computer programs a 
company uses to estimate relationships may be patented and not subject 
to peer review or outside evaluation.

   The relationship between formal education and economic growth in 
poor countries is widely misunderstood by economists and politicians 
alike. Progress in both area is undoubtedly necessary for the social, 
political and intellectual development of these and all other societies; 
however, the conventional view that education should be one of the very 
highest priorities for promoting rapid economic development in poor 
countries is wrong. We are fortunate that is it, because building new 
educational systems there and putting enough people through them to 
improve economic performance would require two or three generations. The 
findings of a research institution have consistently shown that workers 
in all countries can be trained on the job to achieve radically higher 
productivity and, as a result, radically higher standards of living. 
   Ironically, the first evidence for this idea appeared in the United 
States. Not long ago, with the country entering a recessing and Japan at 
its pre-bubble peak. The U.S. workforce was derided as poorly educated 
and one of the primary cause of the poor U.S. economic performance. 
Japan was, and remains, the global leader in automotive-assembly 
productivity. Yet the research revealed that the U.S. factories of Honda, 
Nissan, and Toyota achieved about 95 percent of the productivity of 
their Japanese counterparts -- a result of the training that U.S. 
workers received on the job. 
   More recently, while examining housing construction, the researchers 
discovered that illiterate, non-English- speaking Mexican workers in 
Houston, Texas, consistently met best-practice labor productivity 
standards despite the complexity of the building industry's work. 
   What is the real relationship between education and economic 
development? We have to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes 
the development of education even when governments don't force it. After 
all, that's how education got started. When our ancestors were hunters 
and gatherers 10,000 years ago, they didn't have time to wonder much 
about anything besides finding food. Only when humanity began to get its 
food in a more productive way was there time for other things. 
   As education improved, humanity's productivity potential increased 
as well. When the competitive environment pushed our ancestors to 
achieve that potential, they could in turn afford more education. This 
increasingly high level of education is probably a necessary, but not a 
sufficient, condition for the complex political systems required by 
advanced economic performance. Thus poor countries might not be able to 
escape their poverty traps without political changes that may be 
possible only with broader formal education. A lack of formal education, 
however, doesn't constrain the ability of the developing world's 
workforce to substantially improve productivity for the foreseeable 
future. On the contrary, constraints on improving productivity explain 
why education isn't developing more quickly there than it is. 31. The 
author holds in paragraph 1 that the important of education in poor

   The most thoroughly studied intellectuals in the history of the New 
World are the ministers and political leaders of seventeenth-century New 
England. According to the standard history of American philosophy, 
nowhere else in colonial America was "So much importance attached to 
intellectual pursuits. " According to many books and articles, New 
England's leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an 
unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life. 
   To take this approach to the New Englanders normally means to start 
with the Puritans' theological innovations and their distinctive ideas 
about the church-important subjects that we may not neglect. But in 
keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life, we may 
consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture, 
adjusting to New World circumstances. The New England colonies were the 
scenes of important episodes in the pursuit of widely understood ideals 
of civility and virtuosity. 
   The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive 
education and influence 
   97 
   in England. Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to 
Massachusetts church in the decade after 1629,There were political 
leaders like John Winthrop, an educated gentleman, lawyer, and official 
of the Crown before he journeyed to Boston. There men wrote and 
published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, 
and giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness. 
   We should not forget , however, that most New Englanders were less 
well educated. While few craftsmen or farmers, let alone dependents and 
servants, left literary compositions to be analyzed, it is obvious that 
their views were less fully intellectualized. Their thinking often had a 
traditional superstitions quality. A tailor named John Dane, who 
emigrated in the late 1630s, left an account of his reasons for leaving 
England that is filled with signs. Sexual confusion, economic 
frustrations , and religious hope―all came together in a decisive 
moment when he 
   opened the Bible, told his father the first line he saw would settle 
his fate, and read the magical words: "come out from among them, touch 
no unclean thing , and I will be your God and you shall be my people." 
One wonders what Dane thought of the careful sermons explaining the 
Bible that he heard in puritan churches. 
   Meanwhile, many settles had slighter religious commitments than 
Dane's, as one clergyman learned in confronting folk along the coast who 
mocked that they had not come to the New world for religion . "Our main 
end was to catch fish. "

   Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution 
proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin in the 1860s, British 
social philosopher Herbert Spencer put forward his own theory of 
biological and cultural evolution. Spencer argued that all worldly 
phenomena, including human societies, changed over time, advancing 
toward perfection. 41.____________. 
   American social scientist Lewis Henry Morgan introduced another 
theory of cultural evolution in the late 1800s. Morgan, along with Tylor, 
was one of the founders of modern anthropology. In his work, he 
attempted to show how all aspects of culture changed together in the 
evolution of societies.42._____________. 
   In the early 1900s in North America, German-born American 
anthropologist Franz Boas developed a new theory of culture known as 
historical particularism. Historical particularism, which emphasized the 
uniqueness of all cultures, gave new direction to anthropology. 
43._____________. 
   Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the 
result of a unique history and not as one of many cultures belonging to 
a broader evolutionary stage or type of culture. 44._______________. 
   Historical particularism became a dominant approach to the study of 
culture in American anthropology, largely through the influence of many 
students of Boas. But a number of anthropologists in the early 1900s 
also rejected the particularist theory of culture in favor of 
diffusionism. Some attributed virtually every important cultural 
achievement to the inventions of a few, especially gifted peoples that, 
according to diffusionists, then spread to other cultures. 
45.________________. 
   Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist ?mile Durkheim developed 
a theory of culture 
   99 
   that would greatly influence anthropology. Durkheim proposed that 
religious beliefs functioned to reinforce social solidarity. An interest 
in the relationship between the function of society and culture―known 
as functionalism―became a major theme in European, and especially 
British, 
   anthropology. 
   [A] Other anthropologists believed that cultural innovations, such 
as inventions, had a single 
   origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as 
diffusionism. [B] In order to study particular cultures as completely as 
possible, Boas became skilled in 
   linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, 
the study of human 
   biology and anatomy. 
   [C] He argued that human evolution was characterized by a struggle 
he called the "survival of 
   the fittest," in which weaker races and societies must eventually be 
replaced by stronger, 
   more advanced races and societies. 
   [D] They also focused on important rituals that appeared to preserve 
a people's social structure, 
   such as initiation ceremonies that formally signify children's 
entrance into adulthood. [E] Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of 
culture, such as the structure of families, forms of 
   marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of 
government, technology, 
   and systems of food production, all changed as societies evolved. 
   [F] Supporters of the theory viewed as a collection of integrated 
parts that work together to 
   keep a society functioning. 
   [G] For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. 
J. Perry incorrectly 
   suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, 
pottery making, and 
   metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused throughout 
the world. In fact, all of 
   these cultural developments occurred separately at different times 
in many parts of the 
   world.

   There is a marked difference between the education which everyone 
gets from living with others, and the deliberate educating of the young. 
In the former case the education is incidental; it is natural and 
important, but it is not the express reason of the association. (46) It 
may be said that the measure of the worth of any social institution is 
its effect in enlarging and improving experience; but this effect is not 
a part of its original motive. Religious associations began, for 
   example, in the desire to secure the favor of overruling powers and 
to ward off evil influences; family life in the desire to gratify 
appetites and secure family perpetuity; systematic labor, for the most 
part, because of enslavement to others, etc. (47) Only gradually was the 
by-product of the institution noted, and only more gradually still was 
this effect considered as a directive factor in the conduct of the 
institution. Even today, in our industrial life, apart from certain 
values of 
   100 
   industriousness and thrift, the intellectual and emotional reaction 
of the forms of human association under which the world's work is 
carried on receives little attention as compared with physical output. 
   But in dealing with the young, the fact of association itself as an 
immediate human fact, gains in importance. (48) While it is easy to 
ignore in our contact with them the effect of our acts upon their 
disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with adults. The need of 
training is too 
   evident; the pressure to accomplish a change in their attitude and 
habits is too urgent to leave these consequences wholly out of account. 
(49) Since our chief business with them is to enable them to share in a 
common life we cannot help considering whether or no we are forming the 
powers which will secure this ability. If humanity has made some headway 
in realizing that the 
   ultimate value of every institution is its distinctively human 
effect we may well believe that this lesson has been learned largely 
through dealings with the young. 
   (50) We are thus led to distinguish, within the broad educational 
process which we have been so far considering, a more formal kind of 
education -- that of direct tuition or schooling. In undeveloped social 
groups, we find very little formal teaching and training. These groups 
mainly rely for instilling needed dispositions into the young upon the 
same sort of association which keeps the adults loyal to their group.

   The idea that some groups of people may be more intelligent than 
others is one of those hypotheses that dare not speak its name. But 
Gregory Cochran is 1 to say it anyway. He 
   is that 2 bird, a scientist who works independently 3 any 
institution. He helped 
   popularize the idea that some diseases not 4 thought to have a 
bacterial cause were 
   actually infections, which aroused much controversy when it was 
first suggested. 
   5 he, however, might tremble at the 6 of what he is about to do. 
Together 
   with another two scientists, he is publishing a paper which not only 
7 that one group of 
   humanity is more intelligent than the others, but explains the 
process that has brought this about. The group in 8 are a particular 
people originated from central Europe. The process is natural selection. 
   This group generally do well in IQ test, 9 12-15 points above the 10 
value 
   of 100, and have contributed 11 to the intellectual and cultural 
life of the West, as the 12 of their elites, including several world-
renowned scientists, 13. They also 
   suffer more often than most people from a number of nasty genetic 
diseases, such as breast cancer. These facts, 14, have previously been 
thought unrelated. The former has been 15 to social effects, such as a 
strong tradition of 16 education. The latter was seen 
   as a (an) 17 of genetic isolation. Dr. Cochran suggests that the 
intelligence and diseases are intimately 18. His argument is that the

   While still catching up to men in some spheres of modern life, women 
appear to be way ahead in at least one undesirable category. DWomen are 
particularly susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorders 
in response to stress compared to men,‖ according to Dr. 
   Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York‘s Veteran‘s Administration 
Hospital. 
   Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones 
somehow affect the stress response, causing females under stress to 
produce more of the trigger chemicals than do males under the same 
conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had 
their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical 
responses became equal to those of the males. 
   Adding to a woman‘s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her 
increased Dopportunities‖ for stress. DIt‘s not necessarily that 
women don‘t cope as well. It‘s just that they have so much more to 
cope with,‖ says Dr. Yehuda. DTheir capacity for tolerating stress may 
even be greater than men‘s,‖ she observes, Dit‘s just that they‘re 
dealing with so many more things that they become worn out from it more 
visibly and sooner.‖ 
   Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. DI think 
that the kinds of things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of 
a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are exposed to combat 
stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The 
kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in 
domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, 
and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wear-and-tear that comes 
from these longer relationships can be quite devastating.‖ 
   Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was 
determined to finish college. DI struggled a lot to get the college 
degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my escape, to 
go to school, and get ahead and do better.‖ Later, her marriage ended 
and she became a single mother. DIt‘s the hardest thing to take care 
of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the 
   car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck.‖ 
   Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses 
Alvarez describes. But most women today are coping with a lot of 
obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. Alvarez‘s 
experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress 
before it threatens your health and your ability to function. 
   21. Which of the following is true according to the first two 
paragraphs? 
   [A] Women are biologically more vulnerable to stress. 
   [B] Women are still suffering much stress caused by men. 
   105 
   [C] Women are more experienced than men in coping with stress. 
   [D] Men and women show different inclinations when faced with stress. 
22. Dr. Yehuda‘s research suggests that women 
   [A] need extra doses of chemicals to handle stress. 
   [B] have limited capacity for tolerating stress. 
   [C] are more capable of avoiding stress. 
   [D] are exposed to more stress. 
   23. According to Paragraph 4, the stress women confront tends to be 
   [A] domestic and temporary. 
   [B] irregular and violent. 
   [C] durable and frequent. 
   [D] trivial and random. 
   24. The sentence DI lived from paycheck to paycheck.‖ (Line 6, 
Para. 5) shows that 
   [A] Alvarez cared about nothing but making money. 
   [B] Alvarez‘s salary barely covered her household expenses. 
   [C] Alvarez got paychecks from different jobs. 
   [D] Alvarez paid practically everything by check. 
   25. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

   [B] Responses to Stress: Gender Difference

   It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working 
together in the laboratory would submit the results of their research to 
a journal. A journal editor would then remove the authors‘ names and 
affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review. 
Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper 
for publication or decline it. Copyright rested with the journal 
publisher, and researchers seeking knowledge of the results would have 
to subscribe to the journal. 
   No longer. The Internet C and pressure from funding agencies, who 
are questioning why commercial publishers are making money from 
government-funded research by restricting access to it C is making 
access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing 
the far-reaching consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of 
Victoria University in Australia and 
   106 
   Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who 
have, so far, made handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It 
signals a change in what has, until now, been a key element of 
scientific endeavor. 
   The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in 
research depends, in part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It 
is big business. In America, the core scientific publishing market is 
estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The International 
Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that 
there are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these 
subjects. They publish more than 1.2 million articles each year in some 
16,000 journals. 
   This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of 
scholarly journals are now online. Entirely new business models are 
emerging; three main ones were identified by the report‘s authors. 
There is the so-called big deal, where institutional subscribers pay for 
access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing 
agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by 
asking the author (or his employer) to pay for the paper to be published. 
Finally, there are open-access archives, where organizations such as 
universities or international laboratories support institutional 
repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such 
as delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a 
paper for the first six months, before making it freely available to 
everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional 
form of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers. 
   26. In the first paragraph, the author discusses 
   [A] the background information of journal editing. 
   [B] the publication routine of laboratory reports. 
   [C] the relations of authors with journal publishers. 
   [D] the traditional process of journal publication. 
   27. Which of the following is true of the OECD report? 
   [A] It criticizes government-funded research. 
   [B] It introduces an effective means of publication. 
   [C] It upsets profit-making journal publishers. 
   [D] It benefits scientific research considerably. 
   28. According to the text, online publication is significant in that 
   [A] it provides an easier access to scientific results. 
   [B] it brings huge profits to scientific researchers. 
   [C] it emphasizes the crucial role of scientific knowledge. 
   [D] it facilitates public investment in scientific research. 
   29. With the open-access publishing model, the author of a paper is 
required to 
   [A] cover the cost of its publication. 
   107 
   [B] subscribe to the journal publishing it. 
   [C] allow other online journals to use it freely. 
   [D] complete the peer-review before submission. 
   30. Which of the following best summarizes the text? 
   [A] The Internet is posing a threat to publishers. 
   [B] A new mode of publication is emerging. 
   [C] Authors welcome the new channel for publication. 
   [D] Publication is rendered easier by online service. 
   Text 3 
   In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of only three players in 
the National Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If 
he had played last season, however, he would have been one of 42. The 
bodies playing major professional sports have changed dramatically over 
the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust team 
uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames. 
   The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized 
reality: Americans have generally stopped growing. Though typically 
about two inches taller now than 140 years ago, today‘s people C 
especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many 
generations C apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And 
they aren‘t likely to get any 
   taller. DIn the general population today, at this genetic, 
environmental level, we‘ve pretty much gone as far as we can go,‖ says 
anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In 
the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from 
the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the 
world. 
   Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands 
calories and nutrients C 
   notably, protein C to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 
20th century, under-nutrition and childhood infections got in the way. 
But as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have, on 
average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years, 
a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height C 5′9″ for 
men, 5′4″ for women C hasn‘t really changed since 1960. 
   Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial 
height. During childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing 
through the birth canal. Moreover, even though humans have been upright 
for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle with 
bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by 
oversize limbs. DThere are some real constraints that are set by the 
genetic architecture of the individual organism,‖ says 
   anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern University. 
   Genetic maximums can change, but don‘t expect this to happen soon. 
Claire C. Gordon, senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in 
Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent of the uniforms and workstations 
fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for 
basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some 
time. And if you need to predict human height in the near future to 
design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by and 
   108 
   large, Dyou could use today‘s data and feel fairly confident.‖

   33. On which of the following statements would the author most 
probably agree? 
   [A] Non-Americans add to the average height of the nation. 
   [B] Human height is conditioned by the upright posture. 
   [C] Americans are the tallest on average in the world. 
   [D] Larger babies tend to become taller in adulthood. 34. We learn 
from the last paragraph that in the near future 
   [A] the garment industry will reconsider the uniform size. 
   [B] the design of military uniforms will remain unchanged. 
   [C] genetic testing will be employed in selecting sportsmen. 
   [D] the existing data of human height will still be applicable. 35. 
The text intends to tell us that 
   [A] the change of human height follows a cyclic pattern. 
   [B] human height is becoming even more predictable. 
   [C] Americans have reached their genetic growth limit. 
   [D] the genetic pattern of Americans has altered. 
   Text 4 
   In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, 
George Washington, 52, 
   was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth 
into his jaw C having extracted 
   them from the mouths of his slaves. 
   That‘s a far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George 
most people remember from their history books. But recently, many 
historians have begun to focus on the roles slavery 
   played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been 
spurred in part by DNA evidence 
   109 
   made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas 
Jefferson had fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. 
And only over the past 30 years have scholars examined history from the 
bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the moral compromises made 
by the nation‘s early leaders and the fragile nature of the country‘s 
infancy. More significantly, they argue that many of the Founding 
Fathers knew slavery was wrong C and yet most did little to 
   fight it. 
   More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered 
by the culture of their time. While Washington and Jefferson privately 
expressed distaste for slavery, they also understood that it was part of 
the political and economic bedrock of the country they helped to create. 
   For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. 
Owning slaves was Dlike having a large bank account,‖ says Wiencek, 
author of An Imperfect God: George Washington, 
   His Slaves, and the Creation of America. The southern states would 
not have signed the 
   Constitution without protections for the Dpeculiar institution,‖ 
including a clause that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for 
purposes of congressional representation. 
   And the statesmen‘s political lives depended on slavery. The three-
fifths formula handed 
   Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by 
inflating the votes of the southern states in the Electoral College. 
Once in office, Jefferson extended slavery with the Louisiana Purchase 
in 1803; the new land was carved into 13 states, including three slave 
states. 
   Still, Jefferson freed Hemings‘s children C though not Hemings 
herself or his approximately 
   150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that all men 
were created equal after 
   observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary 
War, overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves 
their freedom in his will. Only a decade earlier, such an act would have 
required legislative approval in Virginia.

   [A] show the primitive medical practice in the past. 
   [B] demonstrate the cruelty of slavery in his days. 
   [C] stress the role of slaves in the U.S. history. 
   [D] reveal some unknown aspect of his life. 
   37. We may infer from the second paragraph that 
   [A] DNA technology has been widely applied to history research. 
   [B] in its early days the U.S. was confronted with delicate 
situations. 
   [C] historians deliberately made up some stories of Jefferson‘s 
life. 
   [D] political compromises are easily found throughout the U.S. 
history.

   The time for sharpening pencils, arranging your desk, and doing 
almost anything else instead of writing has ended. The first draft will 
appear on the page only if you stop avoiding the inevitable and sit, 
stand up, or lie down to write. (41) 
   Be flexible. Your outline should smoothly conduct you from one point 
to the next, but do not permit it to railroad you. If a relevant and 
important idea occurs to you now, work it into the draft. (42) Grammar, 
punctuation, and spelling can wait until you revise. 
   Concentrate on what you are saying. Good writing most often occurs 
when you are in hot pursuit of an idea rather than in a nervous search 
for errors. 
   (43) Your pages will be easier to keep track of that way, and, if 
you have to clip a paragraph to place it elsewhere, you will not lose 
any writing on the other side. 
   If you are working on a word processor, you can take advantage of 
its capacity to make additions and deletions as well as move entire 
paragraphs by making just a few simple keyboard commands. Some software 
programs can also check spelling and certain grammatical elements in 
your writing. (44) These printouts are also easier to read than the 
screen 
   when you work on revisions. 
   Once you have a first draft on paper, you can delete material that 
is unrelated to your thesis and add material necessary to illustrate 
your points and make your paper convincing. The student who wrote DThe 
A & P as a State of Mind‖ wisely dropped a paragraph that questioned 
whether 
   111 
   Sammy displays chauvinistic attitudes toward women. (45) 
   Remember that your initial draft is only that. You should go through 
the paper many times C 
   and then again C working to substantiate and clarify your ideas. 
You may even end up with several entire versions of the paper. Rewrite. 
The sentences within each paragraph should be related to a single topic. 
Transitions should connect one paragraph to the next so that there are 
no abrupt or confusing shifts. Awkward or wordy phrasing or unclear 
sentences and paragraphs should be mercilessly poked and prodded into 
shape. 
   [A] To make revising easier, leave wide margins and extra space 
between lines so that you can 
   easily add words, sentences, and corrections. Write on only one side 
of the paper. [B] After you have clearly and adequately developed the 
body of your paper, pay particular 
   attention to the introductory and concluding paragraphs. It‘s 
probably best to write the 
   introduction last, after you know precisely what you are introducing. 
Concluding 
   paragraphs demand equal attention because they leave the reader with 
a final impression. [C] It‘s worth remembering, however, that though a 
clean copy fresh off a printer may look 
   terrific, it will read only as well as the thinking and writing that 
have gone into it. Many 
   writers prudently store their data on disks and print their pages 
each time they finish a draft 
   to avoid losing any material because of power failures or other 
problems. [D] It makes no difference how you write, just so you do. Now 
that you have developed a topic 
   into a tentative thesis, you can assemble your notes and begin to 
flesh out whatever outline 
   you have made. 
   [E] Although this is an interesting issue, it has nothing to do with 
the thesis, which explains 
   how the setting influences Sammy‘s decision to quit his job. 
Instead of including that 
   paragraph, she added one that described Lengel‘s crabbed response 
to the girls so that she 
   could lead up to the A & P Dpolicy‖ he enforces. 
   [F] In the final paragraph about the significance of the setting 
in DA & P,‖ the student brings 
   together the reasons Sammy quit his job by referring to his refusal 
to accept Lengel‘s store 
   policies. 
   [G] By using the first draft as a means of thinking about what you 
want to say, you will very 
   likely discover more than your notes originally suggested. Plenty of 
good writers don‘t use 
   outlines at all but discover ordering principles as they write. Do 
not attempt to compose a 
   perfectly correct draft the first time around.

   In his autobiography, Darwin himself speaks of his intellectual 
powers with extraordinary modesty. He points out that he always 
experienced much difficulty in expressing himself clearly and concisely, 
but (46) he believes that this very difficulty may have had the 
compensating 
   112 
   advantage of forcing him to think long and intently about every 
sentence, and thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his 
own observations. He disclaimed the possession of any 
   great quickness of apprehension or wit, such as distinguished Huxley. 
(47) He asserted, also, that his power to follow a long and purely 
abstract train of thought was very limited, for which reason he felt 
certain that he never could have succeeded with mathematics. His memory, 
too, he 
   described as extensive, but hazy. So poor in one sense was it that 
he never could remember for more than a few days a single date or a line 
of poetry. (48) On the other hand, he did not accept as well founded the 
charge made by some of his critics that, while he was a good observer, 
he had no power of reasoning. This, he thought, could not be true, 
because the DOrigin of Species‖ is one long argument from the 
beginning to the end, and has convinced many able men. No one, he 
submits, could have written it without possessing some power of 
reasoning. He was willing to assert that DI have a fair share of 
invention, and of common sense or judgment, such as every fairly 
successful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher 
degree.‖ (49) He 
   adds humbly that perhaps he was Dsuperior to the common run of men 
in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them 
carefully.‖ 
   Writing in the last year of his life, he expressed the opinion that 
in two or three respects his mind had changed during the preceding 
twenty or thirty years. Up to the age of thirty or beyond it poetry of 
many kinds gave him great pleasure. Formerly, too, pictures had given 
him considerable, and music very great, delight. In 1881, however, he 
said: DNow for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry. I 
have also almost lost my taste for pictures or music.‖ (50) Darwin was 
convinced that the loss of these tastes was not only a loss of happiness, 
but might possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to 
the moral character.

   By 1830 the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies had become 
independent nations. The roughly 20 million 1 of these nations looked 2 
to the future. Born in the crisis of 
   the old regime and Iberian Colonialism, many of the leaders of 
independence 3 the ideals 
   of representative government, careers 4 to talent, freedom of 
commerce and trade, the 
   5 to private property, and a belief in the individual as the basis 
of society. 6 there 
   was a belief that the new nations should be sovereign and 
independent states, large enough to be economically viable and 
integrated by a 7 set of laws. 
   On the issue of 8 of religion and the position of the church, 9, 
there was less 
   agreement 10 the leadership. Roman Catholicism had been the state 
religion and the only one 11 by the Spanish crown. 12 most leaders 
sought to maintain Catholicism 
   13 the official religion of the new states, some sought to end the 
14 of other faiths. 
   The defense of the Church became a rallying 15 for the conservative 
forces. 
   The ideals of the early leaders of independence were often 
egalitarian, valuing equality of everything. Bolivar had received aid 
from Haiti and had 16 in return to abolish slavery in 
   the areas he liberated. By 1854 slavery had been abolished 
everywhere except Spain‘s 17 
   colonies. Early promises to end Indian tribute and taxes on people 
of mixed origin came much 18 because the new nations still needed the 
revenue such policies 19. Egalitarian 
   sentiments were often tempered by fears that the mass of the 
population was 20 self-rule

   If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player 
in 2006‘s World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy 
quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the 
earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then 
examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and 
professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even 
more pronounced. 
   What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few 
guesses: a) certain astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) 
winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen capacity, which increases 
soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive 
   119 
   children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none 
of the above. 
   Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State 
University, says he believes strongly in Dnone of the above.‖ Ericsson 
grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear engineering until he realized he 
would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he switched 
to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved 
memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of 
numbers. DWith the first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his 
digit span had risen from 7 to 20,‖ Ericsson recalls. DHe kept 
improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 
numbers.‖ 
   This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself 
is not genetically determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of 
memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise than an intuitive one. In 
other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their 
abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each 
person Dencodes‖ the 
   information. And the best way to learn how to encode information 
meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate 
practice. Deliberate practice entails more than simply repeating a task. 
Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback 
and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome. 
   Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert 
performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather 
all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical 
details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with 
high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait 
we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert 
performers C whether in memory or surgery, ballet or 
   computer programming C are nearly always made, not born. 
   21. The birthday phenomenon found among soccer players is mentioned 
to 
   [A] stress the importance of professional training. 
   [B] spotlight the soccer superstars in the World Cup. 
   [C] introduce the topic of what makes expert performance. 
   [D] explain why some soccer teams play better than others. 
   22. The word Dmania‖ (Line 4, Paragraph 2) most probably means 
   [A] fun. 
   [B] craze. 
   [C] hysteria. 
   [D] excitement. 
   23. According to Ericsson, good memory 
   [A] depends on meaningful processing of information. 
   [B] results from intuitive rather than cognitive exercises. 
   [C] is determined by genetic rather than psychological factors. 
   [D] requires immediate feedback and a high degree of concentration. 
   120 
   24. Ericsson and his colleagues believe that 
   [A] talent is a dominating factor for professional success. 
   [B] biographical data provide the key to excellent performance. 
   [C] the role of talent tends to be overlooked. 
   [D] high achievers owe their success mostly to nurture. 
   25. Which of the following proverbs is closest to the message the 
text tries to convey? 
   [A] DFaith will move mountains.‖ 
   [B] DOne reaps what one sows.‖

   For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade 
has featured a column 
   called DAsk Marilyn.‖ People are invited to query Marilyn vos 
Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 
years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 C the highest score 
   ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual 
analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to 
deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit 
confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe 
(whose IQ is 100) as, What‘s the difference between love and fondness? 
Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It‘s not obvious how the 
capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits 
one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and 
philosophers. 
   Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just 
what does it mean to be smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, 
and how much can we learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer 
science and other fields? 
   The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ 
score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be. 
The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence 
Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and 
children‘s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they 
are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them 
populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos 
Savant‘s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a 
   statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than 
simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying 
by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test 
(SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ 
tests. 
   Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements 
necessary to succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. 
In his article DHow Intelligent Is Intelligence 
   Testing?‖, Sternberg notes that traditional test best assess 
analytical and verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and 
practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and 
life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once 
populations or situations change. Research has found that IQ predicted 
leadership skills when the tests were given under 
   121 
   low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was 
negatively correlated with leadership C that is, it predicted the 
opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-
taking skill also matters, whether it‘s knowing when to guess or what 
questions to skip. 
   26. Which of the following may be required in an intelligence test? 
   [A] Answering philosophical questions. 
   [B] Folding or cutting paper into different shapes. 
   [C] Telling the differences between certain concepts. 
   [D] Choosing words or graphs similar to the given ones. 
   27. What can be inferred about intelligence testing from Paragraph 3? 
   [A] People no longer use IQ scores as an indicator of intelligence. 
   [B] More versions of IQ tests are now available on the Internet. 
   [C] The test contents and formats for adults and children may be 
different. 
   [D] Scientists have defined the important elements of human 
intelligence. 28. People nowadays can no longer achieve IQ scores as 
high as vos Savant‘s because 
   [A] the scores are obtained through different computational 
procedures. 
   [B] creativity rather than analytical skills is emphasized now. 
   [C] vos Savant‘s case is an extreme one that will not repeat. 
   [D] the defining characteristic of IQ tests has changed. 
   29. We can conclude from the last paragraph that 
   [A] test scores may not be reliable indicators of one‘s ability. 
   [B] IQ scores and SAT results are highly correlated. 
   [C] testing involves a lot of guesswork. 
   [D] traditional test are out of date. 
   30. What is the author‘s attitude towards IQ tests? 
   [A] Supportive. 
   [B] Skeptical. 
   [C] Impartial. 
   [D] Biased. 
   Text 3 
   During the past generation, the American middle-class family that 
once could count on hard 
   work and fair play to keep itself financially secure had been 
transformed by economic risk and 
   new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing 
spouse can reduce a family 
   from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months. 
   122 
   In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, 
transforming basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics 
of all stripes have debated the social implications of these changes, 
but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well. 
Today‘s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck 
status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times 
of financial setback C a back-up earner (usually Mom) who 
   could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or 
fell sick. This Dadded-worker 
   effect‖ could support the safety net offered by unemployment 
insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad times. 
But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made up with 
extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner. 
   During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more 
risk in their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and 
now those in the auto industry are joining millions of families who must 
worry about interest rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh 
reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the 
past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a 
saving-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their 
guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For 
younger families, the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost 
of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen C and 
newly fashionable health-savings plans are 
   spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much 
higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for 
families‘ future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the 
middle class family, as the odds of having a weak elderly parent C and 
all the 
   attendant need for physical and financial assistance C have jumped 
eightfold in just one 
   generation. 
   From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, 
understandably, looks far less like an opportunity to exercise more 
financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening 
acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already 
overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the 
political fallout may not be far behind. 31. Today‘s double-income 
families are at greater financial risk in that 
   [A] the safety net they used to enjoy has disappeared. 
   [B] their chances of being laid off have greatly increased. 
   [C] they are more vulnerable to changes in family economics. 
   [D] they are deprived of unemployment or disability insurance. 
   32. As a result of President Bush‘s reform, retired people may have 
   [A] a higher sense of security. 
   [B] less secured payments. 
   [C] less chance to invest. 
   [D] a guaranteed future. 
   33. According to the author, health-savings plans will 
   [A] help reduce the cost of healthcare. 
   123 
   [B] popularize among the middle class. 
   [C] compensate for the reduced pensions. 
   [D] increase the families‘ investment risk. 
   34. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that 
   [A] financial risks tend to outweigh political risks. 
   [B] the middle class may face greater political challenges. 
   [C] financial problems may bring about political problems. 
   [D] financial responsibility is an indicator of political status. 
   35. Which of the following is the best title for this text? 
   [A] The Middle Class on the Alert 
   [B] The Middle Class on the Cliff 
   [C] The Middle Class in Conflict 
   [D] The Middle Class in Ruins 
   Text 4 
   It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally 
sorted out their worst accounting and compliance troubles, and improved 
their feeble corporation governance, a new problem threatens to earn 
them C especially in America C the sort of nasty headlines that 
   inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data 
insecurity. Left, until now, to odd, low-level IT staff to put right, 
and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as banking, 
telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on the 
boss‘s agenda in businesses of every variety. 
   Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year C 
from organizations as 
   diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science 
Applications International Corp and even the University of California, 
Berkeley C have left managers hurriedly peering into 
   their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of 
potential vulnerabilities. 
   DData is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any 
other asset,‖ says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University‘s business 
school. DThe ability to guard customer data is the key to market value, 
which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders.‖ Indeed, 
just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security 
Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York‘s 
   Columbia Business School. DSetting the proper investment level for 
security, redundancy, and recovery is a management issue, not a 
technical one,‖ he says. 
   The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. 
Surely it should be obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that 
most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and hugely 
expensive to restore C and that few things are more likely to destroy 
trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong 
hands. 
   The current state of affairs may have been encouraged C though not 
justified C by the lack of 
   124 
   legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until 
California recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell 
anyone, even the victim, when data went astray. That may change fast: 
lots of proposed data-security legislation is now doing the rounds in 
Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 
million credit-card 
   thaccounts in America, disclosed on June 17, overshadowed a hugely 
important decision a day earlier by America‘s Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if 
firms fail to provide adequate data security. 36. The statement DIt 
never rains but it pours‖ is used to introduce 
   [A] the fierce business competition. 
   [B] the feeble boss-board relations. 
   [C] the threat from news reports. 
   [D] the severity of data leakage. 
   37. According to Paragraph 2, some organizations check their systems 
to find out 
   [A] whether there is any weak point. 
   [B] what sort of data has been stolen. 
   [C] who is responsible for the leakage. 
   [D] how the potential spies can be located. 
   38. In bringing up the concept of GASP the author is making the 
point that 
   [A] shareholders‘ interests should be properly attended to. 
   [B] information protection should be given due attention. 
   [C] businesses should enhance their level of accounting security.

   You are going to read a list of headings and a text about what 
parents are supposed to do to guide their children into adulthood. 
Choose a heading from the list A―G that best fits the meaning of 
   each numbered part of the text (41-45). The first and last 
paragraphs of the text are not numbered. There are two extra headings 
that you do not need to use. Mark your answers on ANSWER 
   SHEET 1. (10 points) 
   A. Set a Good Example for Your Kids 
   B. Build Your Kids‘ Work Skills 
   C. Place Time Limits on Leisure Activities

   F. Help Your Kids Figure Out Who They Are 
   G. Build Your Kids‘ Sense of Responsibility 
   How Can a Parent Help? 
   Mothers and fathers can do a lot to ensure a safe landing in early 
adulthood for their kids. Even if a job‘s starting salary seems too 
small to satisfy an emerging adult‘s need for rapid content, the 
transition from school to work can be less of a setback if the start-up 
adult is ready for the move. Here are a few measures, drawn from my book 
Ready or Not, Here Life Comes, 
   that parents can take to prevent what I call Dwork-life 
unreadiness.‖ 
   41 
   You can start this process when they are 11 or 12. Periodically 
review their emerging strengths and weaknesses with them and work 
together on any shortcomings, like difficulty in communicating well or 
collaborating. Also, identify the kinds of interests they keep coming 
back to, as these offer clues to the careers that will fit them best. 
   42 
   Kids need a range of authentic role models C as opposed to members 
of their clique, pop 
   stars and vaunted athletes. Have regular dinner-table discussions 
about people the family knows and how they got where they are. Discuss 
the joys and downsides of your own career and encourage your kids to 
form some ideas about their own future. When asked what they want to do, 
they should be discouraged from saying DI have no idea.‖ They can 
change their minds 200 
   times, but having only a foggy view of the future is of little good. 
   43 
   Teachers are responsible for teaching kids how to learn; parents 
should be responsible for teaching them how to work. Assign 
responsibilities around the house and make sure homework 
   126 
   deadlines are met. Encourage teenagers to take a part-time job. Kids 
need plenty of practice delaying gratification and deploying effective 
organizational skills, such as managing time and setting priorities. 
   44 
   Playing video games encourages immediate content. And hours of 
watching TV shows with canned laughter only teaches kids to process 
information in a passive way. At the same time, listening through 
earphones to the same monotonous beats for long stretches encourages 
kids to stay inside their bubble instead of pursuing other endeavors. 
All these activities can prevent the growth of important communication 
and thinking skills and make it difficult for kids to develop the kind 
of sustained concentration they will need for most jobs. 
   45 
   They should know how to deal with setbacks, stresses and feelings of 
inadequacy. They should also learn how to solve problems and resolve 
conflicts, ways to brainstorm and think critically. Discussions at home 
can help kids practice doing these things and help them apply these 
skills to everyday life situations. 
   What about the son or daughter who is grown but seems to be 
struggling and wandering aimlessly through early adulthood? Parents 
still have a major role to play, but now it is more delicate. They have 
to be careful not to come across as disappointed in their child. They 
should exhibit strong interest and respect for whatever currently 
interests their fledging adult (as naive or ill conceived as it may seem) 
while becoming a partner in exploring options for the future. Most of 
all, these new adults must feel that they are respected and supported by 
a family that appreciates them.

   The study of law has been recognized for centuries as a basic 
intellectual discipline in European universities. However, only in 
recent years has it become a feature of undergraduate programs in 
Canadian universities. (46) Traditionally, legal learning has been 
viewed in such institutions as the special preserve of lawyers, rather 
than a necessary part of the intellectual equipment of an educated 
person. Happily, the older and more continental view of legal 
   education is establishing itself in a number of Canadian 
universities and some have even begun to offer undergraduate degrees in 
law. 
   If the study of law is beginning to establish itself as part and 
parcel of a general education, its aims and methods should appeal 
directly to journalism educators. Law is a discipline which encourages 
responsible judgment. On the one hand, it provides opportunities to 
analyze such 
   127 
   ideas as justice, democracy and freedom. (47) On the other, it links 
these concepts to everyday realities in a manner which is parallel to 
the links journalists forge on a daily basis as they cover and comment 
on the news. For example, notions of evidence and fact, of basic rights 
and public interest are at work in the process of journalistic judgment 
and production just as in courts of law. Sharpening judgment by 
absorbing and reflecting on law is a desirable component of a 
journalist‘s intellectual preparation for his or her career. 
   (48) But the idea that the journalist must understand the law more 
profoundly than an ordinary citizen rests on an understanding of the 
established conventions and special responsibilities of the news media. 
Politics or, more broadly, the functioning of the state, is a major 
subject for journalists. The better informed they are about the way the 
state works, the better their reporting will be. (49) In fact, it is 
difficult to see how journalists who do not have a clear grasp of the 
basic features of the Canadian Constitution can do a competent job on 
political stories. 
   Furthermore, the legal system and the events which occur within it 
are primary subjects for journalists. While the quality of legal 
journalism varies greatly, there is an undue reliance amongst many 
journalists on interpretations supplied to them by lawyers. (50) While 
comment and reaction from lawyers may enhance stories, it is preferable 
for journalists to rely on their own notions of significance and make 
their own judgments. These can only come from a 
   well-grounded understanding of the legal system.

   In spite of Dendless talk of difference,‖ American society is an 
amazing machine for homogenizing people. There is Dthe democratizing 
uniformity of dress and discourse, and the casualness and absence of 
deference‖ characteristic of popular culture. People are absorbed 
into Da culture of consumption‖ launched by the 19th-century 
department stores that offered Dvast 
   arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops 
catering to a knowledgeable elite,‖ these were stores Danyone could 
enter, regardless of class or background. This turned shopping into a 
public and democratic act.‖ The mass media, advertising and sports are 
other 
   133 
   forces for homogenization. 
   Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may 
not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the 
National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports that today‘s 
immigration is neither at unprecedented levels nor resistant to 
assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 
13.6 percent. In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for 
every 1,000 residents; in the 10 years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 
1,000. Now, consider three indices of assimilation -- language, home 
ownership and intermarriage. 
   The 1990 Census revealed that Da majority of immigrants from each 
of the fifteen most common countries of origin spoke 
English ?well‘ or ?very well‘ after ten years of residence.‖ The 
children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in 
English. DBy the third generation, the original language is lost in the 
majority of immigrant families.‖ Hence the description of 
   America as a Dgraveyard‖ for languages. By 1996 foreign-born 
immigrants who had arrived 
   before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than 
the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans. 
   Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics Dhave higher rates of 
intermarriage than do U.S.-born 
   whites and blacks.‖ By the third generation, one third of Hispanic 
women are married to non-Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian-American 
women are married to non-Asians. 
   Rodriguez notes that children in remote villages around the world 
are fans of superstars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, 
yet Dsome Americans fear that immigrants living within the United 
States remain somehow immune to the nation‘s assimilative power.‖ 
   Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? 
Indeed. It is big enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly 
when viewed against America‘s turbulent past, today‘s social indices 
hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment. 
   21. The word Dhomogenizing‖ (Line 2, Paragraph 1) most probably 
means ________. 
   [A] identifying 
   [B] associating 
   [C] assimilating 
   [D] monopolizing 
   22. According to the author, the department stores of the 19th 
century ________. 
   [A] played a role in the spread of popular culture 
   [B] became intimate shops for common consumers 
   [C] satisfied the needs of a knowledgeable elite 
   [D] owed its emergence to the culture of consumption 
   23. The text suggests that immigrants now in the U.S. ________. 
   [A] are resistant to homogenization 
   [B] exert a great influence on American culture 
   134 
   [C] are hardly a threat to the common culture 
   [D] constitute the majority of the population 
   24. Why are Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks mentioned in 
Paragraph 5? 
   [A] To prove their popularity around the world. 
   [B] To reveal the public‘s fear of immigrants. 
   [C] To give examples of successful immigrants. 
   [D] To show the powerful influence of American culture. 
   25. In the author‘s opinion, the absorption of immigrants into 
American society is ________. 
   [A] rewarding 
   [B] successful 
   [C] fruitless 
   [D] harmful 
   Text 2 
   Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry -- William 
Shakespeare -- but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly 
hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which 
presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial 
Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off 
the tourists who come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne 
Hathaway‘s Cottage, Shakespeare‘s birthplace and the other sights. 
   The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a 
penny to their revenue. They frankly dislike the RSC‘s actors, them 
with their long hair and beards and sandals and noisiness. It‘s all 
deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns their 
living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise-
making. 
   The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who 
come by bus -- and often take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on 
the side -- don‘t usually see the plays, and some 
   of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, 
the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. 
It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the town‘s 
revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) 
pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in 
everything and get out of town by nightfall. 
   The townsfolk don‘t see it this way and local council does not 
contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. 
Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in town 
seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its 
own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet 
Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so 
forth, and will be very expensive. 
   Anyway, the townsfolk can‘t understand why the Royal Shakespeare 
Company needs a subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance records for 
three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were 94 percent occupied 
all year long and this year they‘ll do better.) The reason, of 
   135 
   course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed 
low. 
   It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive 
away the young people 
   who are Stratford‘s most attractive clientele. They come entirely 
for the plays, not the sights. They all seem to look alike (though they 
come from all over) -- lean, pointed, dedicated faces, 
   wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for 
the night on the flagstones 
   outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets 
held for the sleepers and sold 
   to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m. 
   26. From the first two paragraphs, we learn that ________. 
   [A] the townsfolk deny the RSC‘s contribution to the town‘s 
revenue 
   [B] the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage 
   [C] the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms 
   [D] the townsfolk earn little from tourism 
   27. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that ________. 
   [A] the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately 
   [B] the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers 
   [C] the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers 
   [D] the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater 28. 
By saying DStratford cries poor traditionally‖ (Line 2-3, Paragraph 4), 
the author implies 
   that ________. 
   [A] Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects 
   [B] Stratford has long been in financial difficulties 
   [C] the town is not really short of money 
   [D] the townsfolk used to be poorly paid 
   29. According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because 
________. 
   [A] ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending 
   [B] the company is financially ill-managed 
   [C] the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable 
   [D] the theatre attendance is on the rise 
   30. From the text we can conclude that the author ________. 
   [A] is supportive of both sides 
   [B] favors the townsfolk‘s view 
   [C] takes a detached attitude 
   [D] is sympathetic to the RSC

   When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something 
strange happened to the large animals. They suddenly became extinct. 
Smaller species survived. The large, slow-growing animals were easy game, 
and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be 
happening in the oceans. 
   That the seas are being overfished has been known for years. What 
researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how 
fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data 
from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to 
estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of 
fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in 
that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in 
Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other 
animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years 
of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved 
again since then. 
   Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative. One 
reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today‘s 
vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, 
   which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher 
proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference 
between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by 
changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have 
been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have 
been caught, since no baited hooks would have been available to trap 
them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. 
Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were 
lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, 
because there are fewer sharks around now. 
   Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct 
baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They 
believe the data support an idea current among marine biologists, that 
of the Dshifting baseline.‖ The notion is that people have failed to 
detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they 
have been looking back only a relatively short time into the past. That 
matters because theory suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that 
can be cropped from a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species 
is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, 
which is a bad way to do business. 
   31. The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest 
that ________. 
   [A] large animal were vulnerable to the changing environment 
   [B] small species survived as large animals disappeared 
   [C] large sea animals may face the same threat today 
   [D] slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones 
   32. We can infer from Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm‘s paper that ________. 
   [A] the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced 
by 90% 
   [B] there are only half as many fisheries as there were 15 years ago 
   [C] the catch sizes in new fisheries are only 20% of the original 
amount 
   137 
   [D] the number of larger predators dropped faster in new fisheries 
than in the old 33. By saying "these figures are conservative" (Line 1, 
paragraph 3), Dr. Worm means that 
   ________. 
   [A] fishing technology has improved rapidly 
   [B] the catch-sizes are actually smaller than recorded 
   [C] the marine biomass has suffered a greater loss 
   [D] the data collected so far are out of date 
   34. Dr. Myers and other researchers hold that ________. 
   [A] people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer 
time 
   [B] fisheries should keep their yields below 50% of the biomass 
   [C] the ocean biomass should be restored to its original level 
   [D] people should adjust the fishing baseline to the changing 
situation 
   35. The author seems to be mainly concerned with most 
fisheries‘ ________. 
   [A] management efficiency 
   [B] biomass level 
   [C] catch-size limits 
   [D] technological application 
   Text 4 
   Many things make people think artists are weird. But the weirdest 
may be this: artists‘ only job is to explore emotions, and yet they 
choose to focus on the ones that feel bad. 
   This wasn‘t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and 
music, are those best 
   suited for expressing joy. But somewhere from the 19th century 
onward, more artists began seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, 
worst of all, boring, as we went from Wordsworth‘s daffodils to 
Baudelaire‘s flowers of evil. 
   You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because 
modern times have seen so much misery. But it‘s not as if earlier times 
didn‘t know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of innocents. The 
reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn 
happiness in the world today. 
   After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost 
completely dedicated to depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of 
anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass media, and 
with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal 
but an ideology. 
   People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They 
worked until exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In 
the West, before mass communication and literacy, the most powerful mass 
medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls were 
in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, 
they did not 
   138 
   exactly need their art to be a bummer too. 
   Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not 
religious but commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news 
anchors, text messengers, all smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines 
feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And 
since these messages have an agenda -- to lure us to open our wallets -- 
they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable. DCelebrate!‖ 
commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before we found out 
it could increase the risk of heart attacks. 
   But what we forget -- what our economy depends on us forgetting -- 
is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain. The things that 
bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss and 
disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need 
art to tell us, as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you 
will die, that everything ends, 
   and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. 
It‘s a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a 
breath of fresh air. 
   36. By citing the examples of poets Wordsworth and Baudelaire, the 
author intends to show that 
   ________. 
   [A] poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music 
   [B] art grows out of both positive and negative feelings 
   [C] poets today are less skeptical of happiness 
   [D] artists have changed their focus of interest 
   37. The word Dbummer‖ (Line 5, paragraph 5) most probably means 
something ________. 
   [A] religious 
   [B] unpleasant 
   [C] entertaining 
   [D] commercial 
   38. In the author‘s opinion, advertising ________. 
   [A] emerges in the wake of the anti-happy art 
   [B] is a cause of disappointment for the general public 
   [C] replaces the church as a major source of information 
   [D] creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself 
   39. We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes 
________. 
   [A] happiness more often than not ends in sadness 
   [B] the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing 
   [C] misery should be enjoyed rather than denied 
   [D] the anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms 
   139 
   40. Which of the following is true of the text?

   On the north bank of the Ohio river sits Evansville, Ind., home of 
David Williams, 52, and of a riverboat casino (a place where gambling 
games are played). During several years of gambling in that casino, 
Williams, a state auditor earning $35,000 a year, lost approximately 
$175,000. He had never gambled before the casino sent him a coupon for 
$20 worth of gambling. 
   He visited the casino, lost the $20 and left. On his second visit he 
lost $800. The casino issued to him, as a good customer, a "Fun Card", 
which when used in the casino earns points for meals and drinks, and 
enables the casino to track the user‘s gambling activities. For 
Williams, those activities become what he calls "electronic heroin". 
   (41) ________. In 1997 he lost $21,000 to one slot machine in two 
days. In March 1997 he lost $72,186. He sometimes played two slot 
machines at a time, all night, until the boat docked at 5 a.m., then 
went back aboard when the casino opened at 9 a.m. Now he is suing the 
casino, charging that it should have refused his patronage because it 
knew he was addicted. It did know he had a problem. 
   In March 1998 a friend of Williams‘s got him involuntarily confined 
to a treatment center 
   for addictions, and wrote to inform the casino of Williams‘s 
gambling problem. The casino included a photo of Williams among those of 
banned gamblers, and wrote to him a Dcease admissions‖ letter. Noting 
the medical/psychological nature of problem gambling behavior, the 
   letter said that before being readmitted to the casino he would have 
to present medical/psychological information demonstrating that 
patronizing the casino would pose no threat to his safety or well-being. 
   (42) ________. 
   The Wall Street Journal reports that the casino has 24 signs 
warning: DEnjoy the fun... and always bet with your head, not over 
it.‖ Every entrance ticket lists a toll-free number for 
   counseling from the Indiana Department of Mental Health. 
Nevertheless, Williams‘s suit charges 
   that the casino, knowing he was Dhelplessly addicted to gambling,‖ 
intentionally worked to Dlure‖ him to Dengage in conduct against his 
will.‖ Well. 
   140 
   (43) ________. 
   The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders says 
   Dpathological gambling‖ involves persistent, recurring and 
uncontrollable pursuit less of money than of thrill of taking risks in 
quest of a windfall. 
   (44) ________. Pushed by science, or what claims to be science, 
society is reclassifying what once were considered character flaws or 
moral failings as personality disorders akin to physical disabilities. 
   (45) ________. 
   Forty-four states have lotteries, 29 have casinos, and most of these 
states are to varying degrees dependent on -- you might say addicted to 
-- revenues from wagering. And since the first Internet gambling site 
was created in 1995, competition for gamblers‘ dollars has become 
intense. The Oct. 28 issue of Newsweek reported that 2 million gamblers 
patronize 1,800 virtual casinos every week. With $3.5 billion being lost 
on Internet wagers this year, gambling has passed pornography as the 
Web‘s most profitable business. 
   [A] Although no such evidence was presented, the casino‘s marketing 
department continued to 
   pepper him with mailings. And he entered the casino and used his Fun 
Card without being 
   detected. 
   [B] It is unclear what luring was required, given his compulsive 
behavior. And in what sense 
   was his will operative? 
   [C] By the time he had lost $5,000 he said to himself that if he 
could get back to even, he would 
   quit. One night he won $5,500, but he did not quit. 
   [D] Gambling has been a common feature of American life forever, but 
for a long time it was 
   broadly considered a sin, or a social disease. Now it is a social 
policy: the most important 
   and aggressive promoter of gambling in America is the government. 
   [E] David Williams‘s suit should trouble this gambling nation. But 
don‘t bet on it. 
   [F] It is worrisome that society is medicalizing more and more 
behavioral problems, often 
   defining as addictions what earlier, sterner generations explained 
as weakness of will. [G] The anonymous, lonely, undistracted nature of 
online gambling is especially conducive to 
   compulsive behavior. But even if the government knew how to move 
against Internet 
   gambling, what would be its grounds for doing so?

ANSWER SHEET 2. (10 points) 
   Is it true that the American intellectual is rejected and considered 
of no account in his society? I am going to suggest that it is not true. 
Father Bruckberger told part of the story when he observed that it is 
the intellectuals who have rejected America. But they have done more 
than 
   141 
   that. They have grown dissatisfied with the role of intellectual. It 
is they, not America, who have become anti-intellectual. 
   First, the object of our study pleads for definition. What is an 
intellectual? 46) I shall define him as an individual who has elected as 
his primary duty and pleasure in life the activity of thinking in a 
Socratic (苏格拉底) way about moral problems. He explores such problems 
   consciously, articulately, and frankly, first by asking factual 
questions, then by asking moral questions, finally by suggesting action 
which seems appropriate in the light of the factual and moral 
information which he has obtained. 47) His function is analogous to that 
of a judge, who must accept the obligation of revealing in as obvious a 
manner as possible the course of reasoning which led him to his decision. 
   This definition excludes many individuals usually referred to as 
intellectuals -- the average scientist, for one. 48) I have excluded him 
because, while his accomplishments may contribute to the solution of 
moral problems, he has not been charged with the task of approaching any 
but the factual aspects of those problems. Like other human beings, he 
encounters moral issues even in 
   the everyday performance of his routine duties -- he is not supposed 
to cook his experiments, manufacture evidence, or doctor his reports. 49) 
But his primary task is not to think about the moral code which governs 
his activity, any more than a businessman is expected to dedicate his 
energies to an exploration of rules of conduct in business. During most 
of his waking life he will 
   take his code for granted, as the businessman takes his ethics. 
   The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the 
fact that teaching has traditionally been the method whereby many 
intellectuals earn their living. 50) They may teach very well and more 
than earn their salaries, but most of them make little or no independent 
reflections on human problems which involve moral judgment. This 
description even fits the 
   majority of eminent scholars. Being learned in some branch of human 
knowledge is one thing, living in "public and illustrious thoughts,‖ as 
Emerson would say, is something else.

   The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be 
insensitive smellers 
   compared with animals, 1 this is largely because, 2 animals, we 
stand upright. 
   This means that our noses are 3 to perceiving those smells which 
float through the air, 4 the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. 
In fact, 5, we are extremely 
   sensitive to smells, 6 we do not generally realize it. Our noses are 
capable of 7 
   human smells even when these are 8 to far below one part in one 
million. 
   Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower 
but not another, 9 
   others are sensitive to the smells of both flowers. This may be 
because some people do not have 
   the genes necessary to generate 10 smell receptors in the nose. 
These receptors are the cells which sense smells and send 11 to the 
brain. However, it has been found that even people insensitive to a 
certain smell 12 can suddenly become sensitive to it when 13 to it often 
enough. 
   The explanation for insensitivity to smell seems to be that the 
brain finds it 14 to 
   keep all smell receptors working all the time but can 15 new 
receptors if necessary. This may 16 explain why we are not usually 
sensitive to our own smells―we simply do not 
   need to be. We are not 17 of the usual smell of our own house, but 
we 18 new 
   smells when we visit someone else‘s. The brain finds it best to 
keep smell receptors 19 
   for unfamiliar and emergency signals 20 the smell of smoke, which 
might indicate the danger of fire.

   Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish 
if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he 
has a reputation for slacking, you might even be outraged. Such 
behaviour is regarded as Dall too human,‖ with the underlying 
assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely 
developed sense of grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de 
Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been 
published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well. 
   The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin 
monkeys. They look cute. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, 
and they share their food readily. Above all, like 
   148 
   their female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer 
attention to the value of Dgoods and services‖ than males. 
   Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr. Brosnan‘s 
and Dr. de Waal‘s study. The researchers spent two years teaching their 
monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy 
enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when 
two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each 
could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their 
behaviour became markedly different. 
   In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much 
preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was handed a grape in 
exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand hers over for a 
mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to 
provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own 
token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the 
slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other 
chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to induce 
resentment in a female capuchin. 
   The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are 
guided by social emotions. In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-
living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable only when each 
animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, 
it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward 
completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the 
group. However, whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently 
in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor 
that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered 
question. 21. In the opening paragraph, the author introduces his topic 
by ________. 
   [A] posing a contrast 
   [B] justifying an assumption 
   [C] making a comparison 
   [D] explaining a phenomenon 
   22. The statement Dit is all too monkey‖ (Last line, Paragraph l) 
implies that ________. 
   [A] monkeys are also outraged by slack rivals 
   [B] resenting unfairness is also monkeys‘ nature 
   [C] monkeys, like humans, tend to be jealous of each other 
   [D] no animals other than monkeys can develop such emotions 
   23. Female capuchin monkeys were chosen for the research most 
probably because they are 
   ________. 
   [A] more inclined to weigh what they get 
   [B] attentive to researchers‘ instructions 
   [C] nice in both appearance and temperament 
   [D] more generous than their male companions 
   149 
   24. Dr. Brosnan and Dr. de Waal have eventually found in their study 
that the monkeys 
   ________. 
   [A] prefer grapes to cucumbers 
   [B] can be taught to exchange things 
   [C] will not be co-operative if feeling cheated 
   [D] are unhappy when separated from others 
   25. What can we infer from the last paragraph? 
   [A] Monkeys can be trained to develop social emotions. 
   [B] Human indignation evolved from an uncertain source. 
   [C] Animals usually show their feelings openly as humans do. 
   [D] Cooperation among monkeys remains stable only in the wild.

   Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking 
would kill us but the doubters insisted that we didn‘t know for sure? 
That the evidence was inconclusive, the science 
   uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of 
life and the government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans 
bought that nonsense, and over three decades, some 10 million smokers 
went to early graves. 
   There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after 
another try to awaken us to the growing threat of global warming. The 
latest was a panel from the National Academy of Sciences, enlisted by 
the White House, to tell us that the Earth‘s atmosphere is definitely 
   warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The clear message 
is that we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the 
National Academy, Bruce Alberts, added this key point in the preface to 
the panel‘s report: DScience never has all the answers. But science 
   does provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it 
is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the 
best judgments that science can provide concerning the future 
consequences of present actions.‖ 
   Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting 
that the science about global warming is incomplete, that it‘s OK to 
keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure. This is a 
dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be 
too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would 
take out an insurance policy now. 
   Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it‘s 
obvious that a majority of the president‘s advisers still don‘t take 
global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they continue to 
press for more research -- a classic case of Dparalysis by analysis.‖ 
   To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press 
forward on deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone 
is inadequate. If the Administration won‘t take the legislative 
initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation 
measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, 
which would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a 
promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build 
lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever going 
to protect the atmosphere, it 
   150 
   is crucial that those new plants be environmentally sound. 
   26. An argument made by supporters of smoking was that ________. 
   [A] there was no scientific evidence of the correlation between 
smoking and death 
   [B] the number of early deaths of smokers in the past decades was 
insignificant 
   [C] people had the freedom to choose their own way of life 
   [D] antismoking people were usually talking nonsense 
   27. According to Bruce Alberts, science can serve as ________. 
   [A] a protector 
   [B] a judge 
   [C] a critic 
   [D] a guide 
   28. What does the author mean by Dparalysis by analysis‖ (Last

   [A] Endless studies kill action. 
   [B] Careful investigation reveals truth.

   Text 3 
   Of all the components of a good night‘s sleep, dreams seem to be 
least within our control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where 
logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century ago, Freud 
formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised 
shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, 
neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just Dmental noise‖ -
- the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during 
sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind‘s 
emotional thermostat, 
   151 
   regulating moods while the brain is Doff-line.‖ And one leading 
authority says that these 
   intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but 
actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel 
better, DIt‘s your dream,‖ says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of 
psychology at Chicago‘s Medical Center. DIf you don‘t like it, change 
it.‖ 
   Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as 
active during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep -- when most vivid dreams 
occur -- as it is when fully awake, says Dr, Eric Nofzinger at the 
University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally 
involved; the limbic system (the Demotional brain‖) is especially 
active, while the prefrontal cortex (the center 
   of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. DWe wake up from 
dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all 
day.‖ says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement. 
   The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in 
Cartwright‘s clinic. 
   Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, 
progressing toward happier ones before awakening, suggesting that they 
are working through negative feelings generated during the day. Because 
our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don‘t always think 
about the emotional significance of the day‘s events -- until, it 
appears, we begin to dream. 
   And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright 
believes one can exercise conscious control over recurring bad dreams. 
As soon as you awaken, identify what is upsetting about the dream. 
Visualize how you would like it to end instead; the next time it occurs, 
try to wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice 
people can learn to, literally, do it in their sleep. 
   At the end of the day, there‘s probably little reason to pay 
attention to our dreams at all unless they keep us from sleeping or Dwe 
wake up in a panic,‖ Cartwright says. Terrorism, economic uncertainties 
and general feelings of insecurity have increased people‘s anxiety. 
Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a 
therapist. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through 
bad feelings. Sleep -- or rather dream -- on it and you‘ll 
   feel better in the morning. 
   31. Researchers have come to believe that dreams ________. 
   [A] can be modified in their courses 
   [B] are susceptible to emotional changes 
   [C] reflect our innermost desires and fears 
   [D] are a random outcome of neural repairs 
   32. By referring to the limbic system, the author intends to show 
________. 
   [A] its function in our dreams 
   [B] the mechanism of REM sleep 
   [C] the relation of dreams to emotions 
   [D] its difference from the prefrontal cortex 
   33. The negative feelings generated during the day tend to ________. 
   [A] aggravate in our unconscious mind 
   152 
   [B] develop into happy dreams 
   [C] persist till the time we fall asleep 
   [D] show up in dreams early at night 
   34. Cartwright seems to suggest that ________. 
   [A] waking up in time is essential to the ridding of bad dreams 
   [B] visualizing bad dreams helps bring them under control 
   [C] dreams should be left to their natural progression 
   [D] dreaming may not entirely belong to the unconscious 
   35. What advice might Cartwright give to those who sometimes have 
bad dreams? 
   [A] Lead your life as usual.

   Text 4 
   Americans no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in 
writing, to command the English language with skill and gift. Nor do 
they aspire to such command themselves. In his latest book, Doing Our 
Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We 
   Should, Like, Care, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist 
of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s 
counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English. 
   Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet 
another criticism against the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter‘s 
academic speciality is language history and change, and he sees the 
gradual disappearance of Dwhom,‖ for example, to be natural and no 
more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English. 
   But the cult of the authentic and the personal, Ddoing our own 
thing,‖ has spelt the death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. 
While even the modestly educated sought an elevated tone when they put 
pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded writing since 
then has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in 
poetry, the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that 
could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written English, talking 
is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over craft. 
   Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high 
and low culture, the trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. 
But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle, why we 
should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of 
human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be 
powerfully expressive -- there exists no language or dialect in the 
world that cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, 
that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper. 
   Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large 
chunks of memorized 
   153 
   poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate 
speech that would seem 
   old-fashioned to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges 
that formal language is 
   not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms -- 
he is really grieving over the 
   loss of something beautiful more than useful. We now take our 
English Don paper plates instead 
   of china.‖ A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one. 
   36. According to McWhorter, the decline of formal English ________. 
   [A] is inevitable in radical education reforms 
   [B] is but all too natural in language development 
   [C] has caused the controversy over the counter-culture 
   [D] brought about changes in public attitudes in the 1960s 37. The 
word Dtalking‖ (Line 6, Paragraph 3) denotes ________. 
   [A] modesty 
   [B] personality 
   [C] liveliness 
   [D] informality 
   38. To which of the following statements would McWhorter most likely 
agree?

   Canada‘s premiers (the leaders of provincial governments), if they 
have any breath left after complaining about Ottawa at their late July 
annual meeting, might spare a moment to do something, together, to 
reduce health-care costs. 
   They‘re all groaning about soaring health budgets, the fastest-
growing component of which 
   are pharmaceutical costs. 
   41. ________ 
   What to do? Both the Romanow commission and the Kirby committee on 
health care -- to say nothing of reports from other experts -- 
recommended the creation of a national drug agency. Instead of each 
province having its own list of approved drugs, bureaucracy, procedures 
and limited bargaining power, all would pool resources, work with Ottawa, 
and create a national institution. 
   42. ________ 
   But Dnational‖ doesn‘t have to mean that. DNational‖ could mean 
interprovincial -- 
   provinces combining efforts to create one body. 
   Either way, one benefit of a Dnational‖ organization would be to 
negotiate better prices, if possible, with drug manufacturers. Instead 
of having one province -- or a series of hospitals within a province -- 
negotiate a price for a given drug on the provincial list, the national 
agency would negotiate on behalf of all provinces. 
   Rather than, say, Quebec, negotiating on behalf of seven million 
people, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of 31 million 
people. Basic economics suggests the greater the potential consumers, 
the higher the likelihood of a better price. 
   43. ________ 
   A small step has been taken in the direction of a national agency 
with the creation of the Canadian Co-ordinating Office for Health 
Technology Assessment, funded by Ottawa and the provinces. Under it, a 
Common Drug Review recommends to provincial lists which new drugs should 
be included. Predictably, and regrettably, Quebec refused to join. 
   A few premiers are suspicious of any federal-provincial deal-making. 
They (particularly Quebec and Alberta) just want Ottawa to fork over 
additional billions with few, if any, strings attached. That‘s one 
reason why the idea of a national list hasn‘t gone anywhere, while drug 
costs keep rising fast. 
   44. ________ 
   Premiers love to quote Mr. Romanow‘s report selectively, especially 
the parts about more federal money. Perhaps they should read what he had 
to say about drugs: DA national drug 
   155 
   agency would provide governments more influence on pharmaceutical 
companies in order to constrain the ever-increasing cost of drugs.‖ 
   45. ________ 
   So when the premiers gather in Niagara Falls to assemble their usual 
complaint list, they should also get cracking about something in their 
jurisdiction that would help their budgets and patients. 
   [A] Quebec‘s resistance to a national agency is provincialist 
ideology. One of the first 
   advocates for a national list was a researcher at Laval University. 
Quebec‘s Drug 
   Insurance Fund has seen its costs skyrocket with annual increases 
from 14.3 per cent 
   to 26.8 per cent! 
   [B] Or they could read Mr. Kirby‘s report: Dthe substantial buying 
power of such an agency 
   would strengthen the public prescription-drug insurance plans to 
negotiate the lowest 
   possible purchase prices from drug companies.‖ 
   [C] What does Dnational‖ mean? Roy Romanow and Senator Michael 
Kirby recommended 
   a federal-provincial body much like the recently created National 
Health Council. 
   [D] The problem is simple and stark: health-care costs have been, 
are, and will continue to 
   increase faster than government revenues. 
   [E] According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, 
prescription drug costs 
   have risen since 1997 at twice the rate of overall health-care 
spending. Part of the 
   increase comes from drugs being used to replace other kinds of 
treatments. Part of it 
   arises from new drugs costing more than older kinds. Part of it is 
higher prices. 
   [F] So, if the provinces want to run the health-care show, they 
should prove they can run it, 
   starting with an interprovincial health list that would end 
duplication, save 
   administrative costs, prevent one province from being played off 
against another, and 
   bargain for better drug prices. 
   [G] Of course, the pharmaceutical companies will scream. They like 
divided buyers; they 
   can lobby better that way. They can use the threat of removing jobs 
from one province 
   to another. They can hope that, if one province includes a drug on 
its list, the pressure 
   will cause others to include it on theirs. They wouldn‘t like a 
national agency, but 
   self-interest would lead them to deal with it.

   It is not easy to talk about the role of the mass media in this 
overwhelmingly significant phase in European history. History and news 
become confused, and one‘s impressions tend to be a mixture of 
skepticism and optimism. 46) Television is one of the means by which 
these feelings are created and conveyed -- and perhaps never before has 
it served so much to connect different peoples and nations as in the 
recent events in Europe. The Europe that is now forming 
   cannot be anything other than its peoples, their cultures and 
national identities. With this in mind 
   156 
   we can begin to analyze the European television scene. 47) In Europe, 
as elsewhere, multi-media groups have been increasingly successful: 
groups which bring together television, radio, newspapers, magazines and 
publishing houses that work in relation to one another. One Italian 
   example would be the Berlusconi group, while abroad Maxwell and 
Murdoch come to mind. 
   Clearly, only the biggest and most flexible television companies are 
going to be able to compete in such a rich and hotly-contested market. 
48) This alone demonstrates that the television business is not an easy 
world to survive in, a fact underlined by statistics that show that out 
of eighty European television networks, no less than 50% took a loss in 
1989. 
   Moreover, the integration of the European community will oblige 
television companies to cooperate more closely in terms of both 
production and distribution. 
   49) Creating a DEuropean identity‖ that respects the different 
cultures and traditions which go to make up the connecting fabric of the 
Old Continent is no easy task and demands a strategic choice -- that of 
producing programs in Europe for Europe. This entails reducing our 
dependence on the North American market, whose programs relate to 
experiences and cultural traditions which are different from our own. 
   In order to achieve these objectives, we must concentrate more on 
co-productions, the exchange of news, documentary services and training. 
This also involves the agreements between European countries for the 
creation of a European bank for Television Production which, on the 
model of the European Investments Bank, will handle the finances 
necessary for production costs. 50) In dealing with a challenge on such 
a scale, it is no exaggeration to say DUnited we stand, divided we 
fall‖ -- and if I had to choose a slogan it would be DUnity in our 
   diversity.‖ A unity of objectives that nonetheless respect the 
varied peculiarities of each country.

   Many theories concerning the causes of juvenile delinquency (crimes 
committed by young people) focus either on the individual or on society 
as the major contributing influence. Theories 21 on the individual 
suggest that children engage in criminal behavior 22 they 
   were not sufficiently penalized for previous misdeeds or that they 
have learned criminal behavior through 23 with others. Theories focusing 
on the role of society suggest that children commit crimes in 24 to 
their failure to rise above their socioeconomic status, 25 
   as a rejection of middle-class values. 
   Most theories of juvenile delinquency have focused on children from 
disadvantaged families, 26 the fact that children from wealthy homes 
also commit crimes. The latter 
   162 
   may commit crimes 27 lack of adequate parental control. All theories, 
however, are tentative and are 28 to criticism. 
   Changes in the social structure may indirectly 29 juvenile crime 
rates. For example, changes in the economy that 30 to fewer job 
opportunities for youth and rising unemployment 31 make gainful 
employment increasingly difficult to obtain. The resulting discontent 
may in 32 lead more youths into criminal behavior. 
   Families have also 33 changes these years. More families consist of 
one-parent households or two working parents; 34, children are likely to 
have less supervision at home 35 was common in the traditional family 36. 
This lack of parental 
   supervision is thought to be an influence on juvenile crime rates. 
Other 37 causes of 
   offensive acts include frustration or failure in school, the 
increased 38 of drugs and 
   alcohol, and the growing 39 of child abuse and child neglect. All 
these conditions tend to increase the probability of a child committing 
a criminal act, 40 a direct causal

   Text 1 
   Hunting for a job late last year, lawyer Gant Redmon stumbled across 
CareerBuilder, a job database on the Internet. He searched it with no 
success but was attracted by the site‘s Dpersonal search agent.‖ 
It‘s an interactive feature that lets visitors key in job criteria such 
as location, title, and salary, then E-mails them when a matching 
position is posted in the database. Redmon chose the keywords legal, 
intellectual property, and Washington, D.C. Three weeks later, he got 
his 
   first notification of an opening. DI struck gold,‖ says Redmon, 
who E-mailed his resume to the 
   employer and won a position as in-house counsel for a company. 
   With thousands of career-related sites on the Internet, finding 
promising openings can be time-consuming and inefficient. Search agents 
reduce the need for repeated visits to the databases. But although a 
search agent worked for Redmon, career experts see drawbacks. Narrowing 
your criteria, for example, may work against you: DEvery time you 
answer a question you eliminate a possibility.‖ says one expert. 
   For any job search, you should start with a narrow concept―what you 
think you want to do 
   -- then broaden it. DNone of these programs do that,‖ says another 
expert. DThere‘s no career counseling implicit in all of this.‖ 
Instead, the best strategy is to use the agent as a kind of tip 
   service to keep abreast of jobs in a particular database; when you 
get E-mail, consider it a reminder to check the database again. DI 
would not rely on agents for finding everything that is added to a 
database that might interest me,‖ says the author of a job-searching 
guide. 
   Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When 
CareerSite‘s agent sends out messages to those who have signed up for 
its service, for example, it includes only three potential jobs -- those 
it considers the best matches. There may be more matches in the database; 
job hunters will have to visit the site again to find them -- and they 
do. DOn the day after we send 
   our messages, we see a sharp increase in our traffic,‖ says Seth 
Peets, vice president of marketing for CareerSite. 
   Even those who aren‘t hunting for jobs may find search agents 
worthwhile. Some use them 
   166 
   to keep a close watch on the demand for their line of work or gather 
information on compensation to arm themselves when negotiating for a 
raise. Although happily employed, Redmon maintains his agent at 
CareerBuilder. DYou always keep your eyes open,‖ he says. Working with 
a personal search agent means having another set of eyes looking out for 
you. 41. How did Redmon find his job? 
   [A] By searching openings in a job database. 
   [B] By posting a matching position in a database. 
   [C] By using a special service of a database. 
   [D] By E-mailing his resume to a database. 
   42. Which of the following can be a disadvantage of search agents? 
   [A] Lack of counseling. 
   [B] Limited number of visits. 
   [C] Lower efficiency. 
   [D] Fewer successful matches. 
   43. The expression Dtip service‖ (Line 4, Paragraph 3) most 
probably means ________. 
   [A] advisory 
   [B] compensation 
   [C] interaction 
   [D] reminder 
   44. Why does CareerSite‘s agent offer each job hunter only three 
job options? 
   [A] To focus on better job matches. 
   [B] To attract more returning visits. 
   [C] To reserve space for more messages. 
   [D] To increase the rate of success. 
   45. Which of the following is true according to the text? 
   [A] Personal search agents are indispensable to job-hunters. 
   [B] Some sites keep E-mailing job seekers to trace their demands. 
   [C] Personal search agents are also helpful to those already 
employed. 
   [D] Some agents stop sending information to people once they are 
employed. Text 2 
   Over the past century, all kinds of unfairness and discrimination 
have been condemned or made illegal. But one insidious form continues to 
thrive: alphabetism. This, for those as yet unaware of such a 
disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames 
begin 
   167 
   with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet. 
   It has long been known that a taxi firm called AAAA cars has a big 
advantage over Zodiac cars when customers thumb through their phone 
directories. Less well known is the advantage that Adam Abbott has in 
life over Zo? Zysman. English names are fairly evenly spread between the 
halves of the alphabet. Yet a suspiciously large number of top people 
have surnames beginning with letters between A and K. 
   Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames 
starting with B and C respectively; and 26 of George Bush‘s 
predecessors (including his father) had surnames in the 
   first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even 
more striking, six of the seven heads of government of the G7 rich 
countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush, Chirac, 
Chrétien and Koizumi). The world‘s three top central bankers (Greenspan, 
Duisenberg and Hayami) are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if 
one of them really uses Japanese characters. As are the world‘s five 
richest men (Gates, Buffett, Allen, Ellison and 
   Albrecht). 
   Can this merely be coincidence? One theory, dreamt up in all the 
spare time enjoyed by the alphabetically disadvantaged, is that the rot 
sets in early. At the start of the first year in infant school, teachers 
seat pupils alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember 
their names. So short-sighted Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row, 
and is rarely asked the improving questions posed by those insensitive 
teachers. At the time the alphabetically disadvantaged may think they 
have had a lucky escape. Yet the result may be worse qualifications, 
because they get less individual attention, as well as less confidence 
in speaking publicly. 
   The humiliation continues. At university graduation ceremonies, the 
ABCs proudly get their awards first; by the time they reach the Zysmans 
most people are literally having a ZZZ. Shortlists for job interviews, 
election ballot papers, lists of conference speakers and attendees: all 
tend to be drawn up alphabetically, and their recipients lose interest 
as they plough through them. 46. What does the author intend to 
illustrate with AAA A cars and Zodiac cars? 
   [A] A kind of overlooked inequality. 
   [B] A type of conspicuous bias. 
   [C] A type of personal prejudice. 
   [D] A kind of brand discrimination. 
   47. What can we infer from the first three paragraphs? 
   [A] In both East and West, names are essential to success. 
   [B] The alphabet is to blame for the failure of Zo? Zysman. 
   [C] Customers often pay a lot of attention to companies‘ names. 
   [D] Some form of discrimination is too subtle to recognize. 
   48. The 4th paragraph suggests that ________. 
   [A] questions are often put to the more intelligent students 
   168 
   [B] alphabetically disadvantaged students often escape from class 
   [C] teachers should pay attention to all of their students 
   [D] students should be seated according to their eyesight 
   49. What does the author mean by Dmost people are literally having 
a ZZZ‖ (Lines 2-3, 
   Paragraph 5)? 
   [A] They are getting impatient. 
   [B] They are noisily dozing off. 
   [C] They are feeling humiliated. 
   [D] They are busy with word puzzles. 
   50. Which of the following is true according to the text? 
   [A] People with surnames beginning with N to Z are often ill-treated. 
   [B] VIPs in the Western world gain a great deal from alphabetism. 
   [C] The campaign to eliminate alphabetism still has a long way to go. 
   [D] Putting things alphabetically may lead to unintentional bias.

   When it comes to the slowing economy, Ellen Spero isn‘t biting her 
nails just yet. But the 
   47-year-old manicurist isn‘t cutting, filling or polishing as many 
nails as she‘d like to, either. Most of her clients spend $12 to $50 
weekly, but last month two longtime customers suddenly stopped showing 
up. Spero blames the softening economy. DI‘m a good economic 
indicator,‖ she 
   says. DI provide a service that people can do without when they‘re 
concerned about saving some dollars.‖ So Spero is downscaling, shopping 
at middle-brow Dillard‘s department store near her 
   suburban Cleveland home, instead of Neiman Marcus. DI don‘t know 
if other clients are going to abandon me, too.‖ she says. 
   Even before Alan Greenspan‘s admission that America‘s red-hot 
economy is cooling, lots of 
   working folks had already seen signs of the slowdown themselves. 
From car dealerships to Gap outlets, sales have been lagging for months 
as shoppers temper their spending. For retailers, who last year took in 
24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the 
cautious approach is coming at a crucial time. Already, experts say, 
holiday sales are off 7 percent from last year‘s pace. But don‘t sound 
any alarms just yet. Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not panicked, 
and many say they remain optimistic about the economy‘s long-term 
prospects, 
   even as they do some modest belt-tightening. 
   Consumers say they‘re not in despair because, despite the dreadful 
headlines, their own fortunes still feel pretty good. Home prices are 
holding steady in most regions. In Manhattan, Dthere‘s a new gold rush 
happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, predominantly fed by 
Wall Street bonuses,‖ says broker Barbara Corcoran. In San Francisco, 
prices are still rising even as frenzied overbidding quiets. DInstead 
of 20 to 30 offers, now maybe you only get two or three,‖ says John 
Tealdi, a Bay Area real-estate broker. And most folks still feel pretty 
   comfortable about their ability to find and keep a job. 
   169 
   Many folks see silver linings to this slowdown. Potential home 
buyers would cheer for 
   lower interest rates. Employers wouldn‘t mind a little fewer 
bubbles in the job market. Many 
   consumers seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, which 
investors now view as a 
   necessary ingredient to a sustained boom. Diners might see an upside, 
too. Getting a table at 
   Manhattan‘s hot new Alain Ducasse restaurant used to be impossible. 
Not anymore. For that, 
   Greenspan & Co. may still be worth toasting.

   [B] Spero is too much engaged in her work 
   [C] Spero has grown out of her bad habit

   Text 4 
   Americans today don‘t place a very high value on intellect. Our 
heroes are athletes, 
   entertainers, and entrepreneurs, not scholars. Even our schools are 
where we send our children to get a practical education -- not to pursue 
knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Symptoms of pervasive anti-
intellectualism in our schools aren‘t difficult to find. 
   DSchools have always been in a society where practical is more 
important than intellectual,‖ says education writer Diane 
Ravitch. DSchools could be a counterbalance.‖ Ravitch‘s latest book, 
Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms, traces the roots of anti-
intellectualism in our 
   schools, concluding they are anything but a counterbalance to the 
American distaste for intellectual pursuits. 
   But they could and should be. Encouraging kids to reject the life of 
the mind leaves them vulnerable to exploitation and control. Without the 
ability to think critically, to defend their ideas and understand the 
ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our democracy. 
Continuing along this path, says writer Earl Shorris, DWe will become a 
second-rate country. We will have a 
   less civil society.‖ 
   DIntellect is resented as a form of power or privilege,‖ writes 
historian and professor Richard Hofstadter in Anti-Intellectualism in 
American Life, a Pulitzer-Prize winning book on the 
   roots of anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and 
education. From the beginning of our history, says Hofstadter, our 
democratic and populist urges have driven us to reject anything that 
smells of elitism. Practicality, common sense, and native intelligence 
have been considered more noble qualities than anything you could learn 
from a book. 
   Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought 
schooling and rigorous book learning put unnatural restraints on 
children: DWe are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for 
10 or 15 years and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not 
know a thing.‖ Mark Twain‘s Huckleberry Finn exemplified American 
anti-intellectualism. 
   Its hero avoids being civilized -- going to school and learning to 
read -- so he can preserve his innate goodness. 
   Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is different from native 
intelligence, a quality we reluctantly admire. Intellect is the critical, 
creative, and contemplative side of the mind. Intelligence seeks to 
grasp, manipulate, re-order, and adjust, while intellect examines, 
ponders, wonders, theorizes, criticizes and imagines. 
   School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted. Hofstadter 
says our country‘s educational system is in the grips of people 
who Djoyfully and militantly proclaim their hostility 
   to intellect and their eagerness to identify with children who show 
the least intellectual promise.‖ 
   56. What do American parents expect their children to acquire in 
school? 
   [A] The habit of thinking independently. 
   [B] Profound knowledge of the world. 
   [C] Practical abilities for future career. 
   [D] The confidence in intellectual pursuits. 
   171 
   57. We can learn from the text that Americans have a history of 
________. 
   [A] undervaluing intellect 
   [B] favoring intellectualism 
   [C] supporting school reform 
   [D] suppressing native intelligence 
   58. The views of Ravitch and Emerson on schooling are ________. 
   [A] identical 
   [B] similar 
   [C] complementary 
   [D] opposite 
   59. Emerson, according to the text, is probably ________. 
   [A] a pioneer of education reform 
   [B] an opponent of intellectualism 
   [C] a scholar in favor of intellect 
   [D] an advocate of regular schooling 
   60. What does the author think of intellect? 
   [A] It is second to intelligence. 
   [B] It evolves from common sense. 
   [C] It is to be pursued. 
   [D] It underlies power.

   The relation of language and mind has interested philosophers for 
many centuries. 61) The Greeks assumed that the structure of language 
had some connection with the process of thought, which took root in 
Europe long before people realized how diverse languages could be. 
   Only recently did linguists begin the serious study of languages 
that were very different from their own. Two anthropologist-linguists, 
Franz Boas and Edward Sapir, were pioneers in describing many native 
languages of North and South America during the first half of the 
twentieth century. 62) We are obliged to them because some of these 
languages have since vanished, as the peoples who spoke them died out or 
became assimilated and lost their native languages. Other linguists in 
the earlier part of this century, however, who were less eager to deal 
with bizarre data from Dexotic‖ language, were not always so grateful. 
63) The newly described 
   languages were often so strikingly different from the well studied 
languages of Europe and 
   172 
   Southeast Asia that some scholars even accused Boas and Sapir of 
fabricating their data. Native 
   American languages are indeed different, so much so in fact that 
Navajo could be used by the US military as a code during World War II to 
send secret messages. 
   Sapir‘s pupil, Benjamin Lee Whorf, continued the study of American 
Indian languages. 64) Being interested in the relationship of language 
and thought, Whorf developed the idea that the structure of language 
determines the structure of habitual thought in a society. He reasoned 
that 
   because it is easier to formulate certain concepts and not others in 
a given language, the speakers of that language think along one track 
and not along another. 65) Whorf came to believe in a sort of linguistic 
determinism which, in its strongest form, states that language imprisons 
the mind, and that the grammatical patterns in a language can produce 
far-reaching consequences for the culture of a society. Later, this idea 
became to be known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, but this term is 
somewhat inappropriate. Although both Sapir and Whorf emphasized the 
diversity of languages, Sapir himself never explicitly supported the 
notion of linguistic determinism. 61. ________

   Text 1 
   Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Internet. The American 
spymaster who built the Office of Strategic Services in the World War II 
and later laid the roots for the CIA was fascinated with information. 
Donovan believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the Dgreat 
game‖ of espionage -- spying as a Dprofession.‖ These days the Net, 
which has already 
   re-made such everyday pastimes as buying books and sending mail, is 
reshaping Donovan‘s 
   vocation as well. 
   The latest revolution isn‘t simply a matter of gentlemen reading 
other gentlemen‘s e-mail. 
   That kind of electronic spying has been going on for decades. In the 
past three or four years, the World Wide Web has given birth to a whole 
industry of point-and-click spying. The spooks call it Dopen-source 
intelligence,‖ and as the Net grows, it is becoming increasingly 
influential. In 1995 the CIA held a contest to see who could compile the 
most data about Burundi. The winner, by a large margin, was a tiny 
Virginia company called Open Source Solutions, whose clear advantage was 
its mastery of the electronic world. 
   Among the firms making the biggest splash in this new world is 
Straitford, Inc., a private intelligence-analysis firm based in Austin, 
Texas. Straitford makes money by selling the results of spying (covering 
nations from Chile to Russia) to corporations like energy-services firm 
McDermott International. Many of its predictions are available online at 
www.straitford.com. 
   Straitford president George Friedman says he sees the online world 
as a kind of mutually reinforcing tool for both information collection 
and distribution, a spymaster‘s dream. Last week his firm was busy 
vacuuming up data bits from the far corners of the world and predicting 
a crisis in Ukraine. DAs soon as that report runs, we‘ll suddenly get 
500 new Internet sign-ups from 
   Ukraine,‖ says Friedman, a former political science 
professor. DAnd we‘ll hear back from some of them.‖ Open-source 
spying does have its risks, of course, since it can be difficult to tell 
good information from bad. That‘s where Straitford earns its keep. 
   Friedman relies on a lean staff of 20 in Austin. Several of his 
staff members have military-intelligence backgrounds. He sees the 
firm‘s outsider status as the key to its success. 
   Straitford‘s briefs don‘t sound like the usual Washington back-
and-forthing, whereby agencies 
   avoid dramatic declarations on the chance they might be wrong. 
Straitford, says Friedman, takes pride in its independent voice. 
   41. The emergence of the Net has ________. 
   [A] received support from fans like Donovan 
   [B] remolded the intelligence services 
   182 
   [C] restored many common pastimes 
   [D] revived spying as a profession 
   42. Donovan‘s story is mentioned in the text to ________. 
   [A] introduce the topic of online spying 
   [B] show how he fought for the U.S. 
   [C] give an episode of the information war 
   [D] honor his unique services to the CIA 
   43. The phrase Dmaking the biggest splash‖ (Line 1, Paragraph 3) 
most probably means 
   ________. 
   [A] causing the biggest trouble 
   [B] exerting the greatest effort 
   [C] achieving the greatest success 
   [D] enjoying the widest popularity 
   44. It can be learned from Paragraph 4 that ________. 
   [A] Straitford‘s prediction about Ukraine has proved true 
   [B] Straitford guarantees the truthfulness of its information 
   [C] Straitford‘s business is characterized by unpredictability 
   [D] Straitford is able to provide fairly reliable information 
   45. Straitford is most proud of its ________. 
   [A] official status 
   [B] nonconformist image 
   [C] efficient staff 
   [D] military background 
   Text 2 
   To paraphrase 18th-century statesman Edmund Burke, Dall that is 
needed for the triumph of a misguided cause is that good people do 
nothing.‖ One such cause now seeks to end biomedical 
   research because of the theory that animals have rights ruling out 
their use in research. Scientists need to respond forcefully to animal 
rights advocates, whose arguments are confusing the public and thereby 
threatening advances in health knowledge and care. Leaders of the animal 
rights movement target biomedical research because it depends on public 
funding, and few people understand the process of health care research. 
Hearing allegations of cruelty to animals in research settings, many are 
perplexed that anyone would deliberately harm an animal. 
   For example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights booth 
at a recent street fair was distributing a brochure that encouraged 
readers not to use anything that comes from or is 
   183 
   tested in animals―no meat, no fur, no medicines. Asked if she 
opposed immunizations, she wanted to know if vaccines come from animal 
research. When assured that they do, she replied, DThen I would have to 
say yes.‖ Asked what will happen when epidemics return, she 
said, DDon‘t worry, scientists will find some way of using 
computers.‖ Such well-meaning people just 
   don‘t understand. 
   Scientists must communicate their message to the public in a 
compassionate, understandable way -- in human terms, not in the language 
of molecular biology. We need to make clear the connection between 
animal research and a grandmother‘s hip replacement, a father‘s bypass 
operation, a baby‘s vaccinations, and even a pet‘s shots. To those who 
are unaware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments, 
as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful 
at best and cruel at worst. 
   Much can be done. Scientists could Dadopt‖ middle school classes 
and present their own research. They should be quick to respond to 
letters to the editor, lest animal rights misinformation go unchallenged 
and acquire a deceptive appearance of truth. Research institutions could 
be opened to tours, to show that laboratory animals receive humane care. 
Finally, because the ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health 
research community should actively recruit to its cause not only well-
known personalities such as Stephen Cooper, who has made courageous 
statements about the value of animal research, but all who receive 
medical treatment. If good people do nothing, there is a real 
possibility that an uninformed citizenry will extinguish the precious 
embers of medical progress. 
   46. The author begins his article with Edmund Burke‘s words to 
________. 
   [A] call on scientists to take some actions 
   [B] criticize the misguided cause of animal rights 
   [C] warn of the doom of biomedical research 
   [D] show the triumph of the animal rights movement 
   47. Misled people tend to think that using an animal in research is 
________. 
   [A] cruel but natural 
   [B] inhuman and unacceptable 
   [C] inevitable but vicious 
   [D] pointless and wasteful 
   48. The example of the grandmotherly woman is used to show the 
public‘s ________. 
   [A] discontent with animal research 
   [B] ignorance about medical science 
   [C] indifference to epidemics 
   [D] anxiety about animal rights 
   184 
   49. The author believes that, in face of the challenge from animal 
rights advocates, scientists 
   should ________. 
   [A] communicate more with the public 
   [B] employ hi-tech means in research 
   [C] feel no shame for their cause 
   [D] strive to develop new cures 
   50. From the text we learn that Stephen Cooper is ________. 
   [A] a well-known humanist 
   [B] a medical practitioner 
   [C] an enthusiast in animal rights 
   [D] a supporter of animal research 
   Text 3 
   In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, 
merging into supersystems, causing heightened concerns about monopoly. 
As recently as 1995, the top four railroads accounted for under 70 
percent of the total ton-miles moved by rails. Next year, after a series 
of mergers is completed, just four railroads will control well over 90 
percent of all the freight moved by major rail carriers. 
   Supporters of the new supersystems argue that these mergers will 
allow for substantial cost reductions and better coordinated service. 
Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is removed by fierce competition 
from trucks. But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk commodities 
traveling long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking 
is too costly and the railroads therefore have them by the throat. 
   The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most 
shippers are served by only one rail company. Railroads typically charge 
such Dcaptive‖ shippers 20 to 30 percent more than they do when 
another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers who feel they 
are being overcharged have the right to appeal to the federal 
government‘s Surface Transportation Board for rate relief, but the 
process is expensive, time-consuming, and will work only in truly 
extreme cases. 
   Railroads justify rate discrimination against captive shippers on 
the grounds that in the long run it reduces everyone‘s cost. If 
railroads charged all customers the same average rate, they argue, 
shippers who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of 
transportation would do so, leaving remaining customers to shoulder the 
cost of keeping up the line. It‘s a theory to which many economists 
subscribe, but in practice it often leaves railroads in the position of 
determining which companies will flourish and which will fail. DDo we 
really want railroads to 
   be the arbiters of who wins and who loses in the marketplace?‖ asks 
Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who frequently represents shippers. 
   Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be hit with a round 
of huge rate increases. The railroad industry as a whole, despite its 
brightening fortunes, still does not earn enough to cover the cost of 
the capital it must invest to keep up with its surging traffic. Yet 
railroads 
   185 
   continue to borrow billions to acquire one another, with Wall Street 
cheering them on. Consider the $10.2 billion bid by Norfolk Southern and 
CSX to acquire Conrail this year. Conrail‘s net railway operating 
income in 1996 was just $427 million, less than half of the carrying 
costs of the transaction. Who‘s going to pay for the rest of the bill? 
Many captive shippers fear that they will, as Norfolk Southern and CSX 
increase their grip on the market. 
   51. According to those who support mergers, railway monopoly is 
unlikely because ________. 
   [A] cost reduction is based on competition 
   [B] services call for cross-trade coordination 
   [C] outside competitors will continue to exist 
   [D] shippers will have the railway by the throat 
   52. What is many captive shippers‘ attitude towards the 
consolidation in the rail industry? 
   [A] Indifferent. 
   [B] Supportive. 
   [C] Indignant. 
   [D] Apprehensive. 
   53. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that ________. 
   [A] shippers will be charged less without a rival railroad 
   [B] there will soon be only one railroad company nationwide 
   [C] overcharged shippers are unlikely to appeal for rate relief 
   [D] a government board ensures fair play in railway business 
   54. The word Darbiters‖ (Line 7, Paragraph 4) most probably refers 
to those ________. 
   [A] who work as coordinators 
   [B] who function as judges 
   [C] who supervise transactions 
   [D] who determine the price 
   55. According to the text, the cost increase in the rail industry is 
mainly caused by ________. 
   [A] the continuing acquisition 
   [B] the growing traffic 
   [C] the cheering Wall Street 
   [D] the shrinking market 
   Text 4 
   It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable 
and in California optional. Small wonder. Americans‘ life expectancy 
has nearly doubled over the past century. Failing hips 
   186 
   can be replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed 
in a 30-minute surgical procedure. Such advances offer the aging 
population a quality of life that was unimaginable when I entered 
medicine 50 years ago. But not even a great health-care system can cure 
death -- and our failure to confront that reality now threatens this 
greatness of ours. 
   Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and 
perish, even under ideal conditions. We all understand that at some 
level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved. 
Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand 
everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it‘s useless. The 
most obvious example is 
   late-stage cancer care. Physicians -- frustrated by their inability 
to cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient -- too often 
offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified. 
   In 1950, the U.S. spent $12.7 billion on health care. In 2002, the 
cost will be $1,540 billion. Anyone can see this trend is unsustainable. 
Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. Some scholars conclude that a 
government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical 
care that sustains life beyond a certain age -- say 83 or so. Former 
Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been quoted as saying that the old 
and infirm Dhave a duty to die and get out of the way,‖ so that 
younger, healthier people can realize their potential. 
   I would not go that far. Energetic people now routinely work through 
their 60s and beyond, and remain dazzlingly productive. At 78, Viacom 
chairman Sumner Redstone jokingly claims to be 53. Supreme Court Justice 
Sandra Day O‘Connor is in her 70s, and former surgeon general C. 
Everett Koop chairs an Internet start-up in his 80s. These leaders are 
living proof that prevention works and that we can manage the health 
problems that come naturally with age. As a mere 68-year-old, I wish to 
age as productively as they have. 
   Yet there are limits to what a society can spend in this pursuit. As 
a physician, I know the most costly and dramatic measures may be 
ineffective and painful. I also know that people in Japan and Sweden, 
countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, 
healthier lives than we have. As a nation, we may be overfunding the 
quest for unlikely cures while underfunding research on humbler 
therapies that could improve people‘s lives. 
   56. What is implied in the first sentence? 
   [A] Americans are better prepared for death than other people. 
   [B] Americans enjoy a higher life quality than ever before. 
   [C] Americans are over-confident of their medical technology. 
   [D] Americans take a vain pride in their long life expectancy. 
   57. The author uses the example of cancer patients to show that 
________. 
   [A] medical resources are often wasted 
   [B] doctors are helpless against fatal diseases 
   [C] some treatments are too aggressive 
   [D] medical costs are becoming unaffordable 
   187 
   58. The author‘s attitude toward Richard Lamm‘s remark is one of 
________. 
   [A] strong disapproval 
   [B] reserved consent 
   [C] slight contempt 
   [D] enthusiastic support 
   59. In contrast to the U.S., Japan and Sweden are funding their 
medical care ________. 
   [A] more flexibly 
   [B] more extravagantly 
   [C] more cautiously 
   [D] more reasonably 
   60. The text intends to express the idea that ________. 
   [A] medicine will further prolong people‘s lives 
   [B] life beyond a certain limit is not worth living 
   [C] death should be accepted as a fact of life 
   [D] excessive demands increase the cost of health care 
   Part B 
   Directions: 
   Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined 
segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written clearly on 
ANSWER SHEET 2. (10 points) 
   Human beings in all times and places think about their world and 
wonder at their place in it. Humans are thoughtful and creative, 
possessed of insatiable curiosity. 61) Furthermore, humans have the 
ability to modify the environment in which they live, thus subjecting 
all other life forms to their own peculiar ideas and fancies. Therefore, 
it is important to study humans in all their 
   richness and diversity in a calm and systematic manner, with the 
hope that the knowledge resulting from such studies can lead humans to a 
more harmonious way of living with themselves and with all other life 
forms on this planet Earth. 
   DAnthropology‖ derives from the Greek words anthropos: Dhuman‖ 
and logos Dthe study 
   of.‖ By its very name, anthropology encompasses the study of all 
humankind. 
   Anthropology is one of the social sciences. 62) Social science is 
that branch of intellectual enquiry which seeks to study humans and 
their endeavors in the same reasoned, orderly, systematic, and 
dispassioned manner that natural scientists use for the study of natural 
phenomena. 
   Social science disciplines include geography, economics, political 
science, psychology, and sociology. Each of these social sciences has a 
subfield or specialization which lies particularly close to anthropology. 
   All the social sciences focus upon the study of humanity. 
Anthropology is a field-study 
   188 
   oriented discipline which makes extensive use of the comparative 
method in analysis. 63) The emphasis on data gathered first-hand, 
combined with a cross-cultural perspective brought to the analysis of 
cultures past and present, makes this study a unique and distinctly 
important social science. 
   Anthropological analyses rest heavily upon the concept of culture. 
Sir Edward Tylor‘s formulation of the concept of culture was one of the 
great intellectual achievements of 19th century science. 64) Tylor 
defined culture as D… that complex whole which includes belief, art, 
morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by 
man as a member of society.‖ This insight, so profound in its 
simplicity, opened up an entirely new way of perceiving and 
understanding human life. Implicit within Tylor‘s definition is the 
concept that culture is learned, shared, and patterned behavior. 
   65) Thus, the anthropological concept of Dculture,‖ like the 
concept of Dset‖ in mathematics, is an abstract concept which makes 
possible immense amounts of concrete research and understanding.

   Comparisons were drawn between the development of television in the 
20th century and the diffusion of printing in the 15th and 16th 
centuries. Yet much had happened 21. As was 
   discussed before, it was not 22 the 19th century that the newspaper 
became the dominant pre-electronic 23, following in the wake of the 
pamphlet and the book and in the 24 of the periodical. It was during the

   Text 1 
   If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you 
must know how to identify shared experiences and problems. Your humor 
must be relevant to the audience and should help to show them that you 
are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in 
sympathy with their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, 
the problems will be different. If you are talking to a group of 
managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries; 
alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment 
on their disorganized bosses. 
   Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses‘ convention, of a 
story which works well because the audience all shared the same view of 
doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is being shown around by St. Peter. 
He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, sunny weather, and 
so on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in 
a line for lunch, the new arrival is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a 
white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, grabs his food and 
stomps over to a table by himself. DWho is that?‖ the new arrival 
asked St. Peter. DOh, that‘s God,‖ came the reply, Dbut sometimes he 
thinks he‘s a doctor.‖ 
   If you are part of the group, which you are addressing, you will be 
in a position to know the experiences and problems which are common to 
all of you and it‘ll be appropriate for you to make a passing remark 
about the inedible canteen food or the chairman‘s notorious bad taste 
in ties. With other audiences you mustn‘t attempt to cut in with humor 
as they will resent an 
   outsider making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their 
chairman. You will be on safer ground if you stick to scapegoats like 
the Post Office or the telephone system. 
   If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it 
becomes more natural. Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff 
remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed and unforced manner. Often 
it‘s the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so speak slowly 
and remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to 
show that you are making a light-hearted remark. 
   Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a 
familiar quote DIf at first you don‘t succeed, give up‖ or a play on 
words or on a situation. Search for exaggeration 
   and understatements. Look at your talk and pick out a few words or 
sentences which you can turn about and inject with humor. 
   41. To make your humor work, you should ________. 
   [A] take advantage of different kinds of audience 
   [B] make fun of the disorganized people 
   198 
   [C] address different problems to different people 
   [D] show sympathy for your listeners 
   42. The joke about doctors implies that, in the eyes of nurses, they 
are ________. 
   [A] impolite to new arrivals 
   [B] very conscious of their godlike role 
   [C] entitled to some privileges 
   [D] very busy even during lunch hours 
   43. It can be inferred from the text that public services ________. 
   [A] have benefited many people 
   [B] are the focus of public attention 
   [C] are an inappropriate subject for humor 
   [D] have often been the laughing stock 
   44. To achieve the desired result, humorous stories should be 
delivered ________. 
   [A] in well-worded language 
   [B] as awkwardly as possible 
   [C] in exaggerated statements 
   [D] as casually as possible 
   45. The best title for the text may be ________. 
   [A] Use Humor Effectively 
   [B] Various Kinds of Humor 
   [C] Add Humor to Speech 
   [D] Different Humor Strategies 
   Text 2 
   Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised ever more 
cunning tools to cope with work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, 
or just plain nasty. That compulsion has resulted in robotics -- the 
science of conferring various human capabilities on machines. And if 
scientists have yet to create the mechanical version of science fiction, 
they have begun to come close. 
   As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by 
intelligent gizmos whose presence we barely notice but whose universal 
existence has removed much human labor. Our factories hum to the rhythm 
of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller 
terminals that thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction. 
Our subway trains are controlled by tireless robot-drivers. And thanks 
to the continual miniaturization of electronics and micro-mechanics, 
there are already robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and 
   199 
   bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy -- far greater precision 
than highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone. 
   But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, 
they will have to operate with less human supervision and be able to 
make at least a few decisions for themselves -- goals that pose a real 
challenge. DWhile we know how to tell a robot to handle a specific 
error,‖ says Dave 
   Lavery, manager of a robotics program at NASA, Dwe can‘t yet give 
a robot enough ?common sense‘ to reliably interact with a dynamic 
world.‖ 
   Indeed the quest for true artificial intelligence has produced very 
mixed results. Despite a spell of initial optimism in the 1960s and 
1970s when it appeared that transistor circuits and microprocessors 
might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010, 
researchers lately have begun to extend that forecast by decades if not 
centuries. 
   What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human 
brain‘s roughly one hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented 
-- and human perception far more complicated -- than previously imagined. 
They have built robots that can recognize the error of a machine panel 
by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory environment. But 
the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately 
disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on 
the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the single suspicious 
face in a big crowd. The most advanced computer systems on Earth can‘t 
approach that kind of ability, and neuroscientists still don‘t know 
quite how we do it.

   Could the bad old days of economic decline be about to return? Since 
OPEC agreed to supply-cuts in March, the price of crude oil has jumped 
to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last December. This near-
tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil shock, 
when prices quadrupled, and 1979-80, when they also almost tripled. Both 
previous shocks resulted in double-digit inflation and global economic 
decline. So where are the headlines warning of gloom and doom this time? 
   The oil price was given another push up this week when Iraq 
suspended oil exports. Strengthening economic growth, at the same time 
as winter grips the northern hemisphere, could push the price higher 
still in the short term. 
   Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic consequences now 
to be less severe than in the 1970s. In most countries the cost of crude 
oil now accounts for a smaller share of the price of petrol than it did 
in the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the 
retail price, so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a 
more muted effect on pump prices than in the past. 
   Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so 
less sensitive to swings in the oil price. Energy conservation, a shift 
to other fuels and a decline in the importance of heavy, energy-
intensive industries have reduced oil consumption. Software, consultancy 
and mobile telephones use far less oil than steel or car production. For 
each dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now use nearly 
50% less oil than in 1973. The OECD estimates in its latest Economic 
Outlook that, if oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, 
compared with $13 in 1998, this would increase the oil import bill in 
rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is less than one-quarter 
of the income loss in 1974 or 1980. On the other hand, oil-importing 
emerging economies -- to which heavy industry has shifted -- have become 
more energy-intensive, and so could be more seriously squeezed. 
   One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is 
that, unlike the rises in the 1970s, it has not occurred against the 
background of general commodity-price inflation and global excess demand. 
A sizable portion of the world is only just emerging from economic 
decline. The Economist’s commodity price index is broadly unchanging 
from a year ago. In 1973 commodity prices jumped by 70%, and in 1979 by 
almost 30%. 
   201 
   51. The main reason for the latest rise of oil price is ________. 
   [A] global inflation 
   [B] reduction in supply 
   [C] fast growth in economy 
   [D] Iraq‘s suspension of exports 
   52. It can be inferred from the text that the retail price of petrol 
will go up dramatically if 
   ________. 
   [A] price of crude rises 
   [B] commodity prices rise 
   [C] consumption rises 
   [D] oil taxes rise 
   53. The estimates in Economic Outlook show that in rich countries 
________. 
   [A] heavy industry becomes more energy-intensive 
   [B] income loss mainly results from fluctuating crude oil prices 
   [C] manufacturing industry has been seriously squeezed 
   [D] oil price changes have no significant impact on GDP 54. We can 
draw a conclusion from the text that ________. 
   [A] oil-price shocks are less shocking now 
   [B] inflation seems irrelevant to oil-price shocks 
   [C] energy conservation can keep down the oil prices 
   [D] the price rise of crude leads to the shrinking of heavy industry 
55. From the text we can see that the writer seems ________. 
   [A] optimistic

   The Supreme Court‘s decisions on physician-assisted suicide carry 
important implications for how medicine seeks to relieve dying patients 
of pain and suffering. 
   Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to 
physician-assisted suicide, the Court 
   in effect supported the medical principle of Ddouble effect,‖ a 
centuries-old moral principle 
   holding that an action having two effects -- a good one that is 
intended and a harmful one that is 
   foreseen -- is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect. 
   202 
   Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using 
high doses of morphine to control terminally ill patients‘ pain, even 
though increasing dosages will eventually kill the patient. 
   Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that 
the principle will shield doctors who Duntil now have very, very 
strongly insisted that they could not give patients 
   sufficient mediation to control their pain if that might hasten 
death.‖ 
   George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston 
University, maintains that, as long as a doctor prescribes a drug for a 
legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done nothing illegal even if 
the patient uses the drug to hasten death. DIt‘s like surgery,‖ he 
says. DWe don‘t call those deaths homicides because the doctors 
didn‘t intend to kill their patients, although they risked their death. 
If you‘re a physician, you can risk your patient‘s suicide as long as 
you don‘t intend their suicide.‖ 
   On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the 
assisted-suicide debate has been fueled in part by the despair of 
patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of 
dying. 
   Just three weeks before the Court‘s ruling on physician-assisted 
suicide, the National 
   Academy of Science (NAS) released a two-volume report, Approaching 
Death: Improving Care 
   at the End of Life. It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the 
aggressive use of Dineffectual and forced medical procedures that may 
prolong and even dishonor the period of dying‖ as the twin problems of 
end-of-life care. 
   The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in 
hospices, to test knowledge of aggressive pain management therapies, to 
develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care, and to develop 
new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life. 
   Annas says lawyers can play a key role in insisting that these well-
meaning medical initiatives translate into better care. DLarge numbers 
of physicians seem unconcerned with the pain their patients are 
needlessly and predictably suffering,‖ to the extent that it 
constitutes 
   Dsystematic patient abuse.‖ He says medical licensing 
boards Dmust make it clear… that painful deaths are presumptively ones 
that are incompetently managed and should result in license 
suspension.‖ 
   56. From the first three paragraphs, we learn that ________. 
   [A] doctors used to increase drug dosages to control their 
patients‘ pain 
   [B] it is still illegal for doctors to help the dying end their 
lives 
   [C] the Supreme Court strongly opposes physician-assisted suicide 
   [D] patients have no constitutional right to commit suicide 
   57. Which of the following statements is true according to the text? 
   [A] Doctors will be held guilty if they risk their patients‘ death. 
   203 
   [B] Modern medicine has assisted terminally ill patients in painless 
recovery. 
   [C] The Court ruled that high-dosage pain-relieving medication can 
be prescribed. 
   [D] A doctor‘s medication is no longer justified by his intentions. 
   58. According to the NAS‘s report, one of the problems in end-of-
life care is ________. 
   [A] prolonged medical procedures 
   [B] inadequate treatment of pain 
   [C] systematic drug abuse 
   [D] insufficient hospital care 
   59. Which of the following best defines the word Daggressive‖ 
(Line 3, Paragraph 7)? 
   [A] Bold 
   [B] Harmful 
   [C] Careless 
   [D] Desperate 
   60. George Annas would probably agree that doctors should be 
punished if they ________. 
   [A] manage their patients incompetently 
   [B] give patients more medicine than needed 
   [C] reduce drug dosages for their patients 
   [D] prolong the needless suffering of the patients

   Almost all our major problems involve human behavior, and they 
cannot be solved by physical and biological technology alone. What is 
needed is a technology of behavior, but we have been slow to develop the 
science from which such a technology might be drawn. 61) One difficulty 
is that almost all of what is called behavioral science continues to 
trace behavior to states of mind, feelings, traits of character, human 
nature, and so on. Physics and biology once 
   followed similar practices and advanced only when they discarded 
them. 62) The behavioral sciences have been slow to change partly 
because the explanatory items often seem to be directly observed and 
partly because other kinds of explanations have been hard to find. The 
environment 
   is obviously important, but its role has remained obscure. It does 
not push or pull, it selects, and this function is difficult to discover 
and analyze. 63) The role of natural selection in evolution was 
formulated only a little more than a hundred years ago, and the 
selective role of the environment in shaping and maintaining the 
behavior of the individual is only beginning to be recognized and 
studied. As the interaction between organism and environment has come to 
be 
   204 
   understood, however, effects once assigned to states of mind, 
feelings, and traits are beginning to be traced to accessible conditions, 
and a technology of behavior may therefore become available. It will not 
solve our problems, however, until it replaces traditional prescientific 
views, and these are strongly entrenched. Freedom and dignity illustrate 
the difficulty. 64) They are the possessions of the autonomous (self-
governing) man of traditional theory, and they are essential to 
practices in which a person is held responsible for his conduct and 
given credit for his achievements. A scientific analysis shifts both the 
responsibility and the achievement to the environment. It also raises 
questions concerning Dvalues.‖ Who will use a technology and to what 
ends? 65) Until these issues are resolved, a technology of behavior will 
continue to be rejected, and with it possibly the only way to solve our 
problems.

subject matter into smaller units, one man could continue to handle the 
information and use it as the basis for further research. But 
specialization was only one of a series of related developments in 
science affecting the process of communication. Another was the growing 
professionalisation of scientific activity. 
   No clear-cut distinction can be drawn between professionals and 
amateurs in science: exceptions can be found to any rule. Nevertheless, 
the word Damateur‖ does carry a connotation that the person concerned 
is not fully integrated into the scientific community and, in particular, 
may not fully share its values. The growth of specialization in the 
nineteenth century, with its consequent requirement of a longer, more 
complex training, implied greater problems for amateur participation in 
science. The trend was naturally most obvious in those areas of science 
based especially on a mathematical or laboratory training, and can be 
illustrated in terms of the development of geology in the United Kingdom. 
   A comparison of British geological publications over the last 
century and a half reveals not simply an increasing emphasis on the 
primacy of research, but also a changing definition of what constitutes 
an acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth century, local 
geological studies represented worthwhile research in their own right; 
but, in the twentieth century, local studies have increasingly become 
acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, 
the wider geological picture. Amateurs, on the other hand, have 
continued to pursue local studies in the old way. The overall result has 
been to make entrance to professional geological journals harder for 
amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread 
introduction of refereeing, first by national journals in the nineteenth 
century and then by several local geological journals in the twentieth 
century. As a logical consequence of this development, separate journals 
have now appeared aimed mainly towards either professional or amateur 
readership. A rather similar process of differentiation has led to 
professional geologists coming together nationally within one or two 
specific societies, whereas the amateurs have tended either to remain in 
local societies or to come together nationally in a different way. 
   Although the process of professionalisation and specialization was 
already well under way in British geology during the nineteenth century, 
its full consequences were thus delayed until the twentieth century. In 
science generally, however, the nineteenth century must be reckoned as 
the crucial period for this change in the structure of science. 
   51. The growth of specialization in the 19th century might be more 
clearly seen in sciences 
   such as ________. 
   [A] sociology and chemistry 
   [B] physics and psychology 
   [C] sociology and psychology 
   216 
   [D] physics and chemistry 
   52. We can infer from the passage that ________. 
   [A] there is little distinction between specialization and 
professionalisation 
   [B] amateurs can compete with professionals in some areas of science 
   [C] professionals tend to welcome amateurs into the scientific 
community

   53. The author writes of the development of geology to demonstrate 
________. 
   [A] the process of specialization and professionalisation

   [C] the change of policies in scientific publications 
   [D] the discrimination of professionals against amateurs 
   54. The direct reason for specialization is ________. 
   [A] the development in communication 
   [B] the growth of professionalisation 
   [C] the expansion of scientific knowledge 
   [D] the splitting up of academic societies

   A great deal of attention is being paid today to the so-called 
digital divide -- the division of the world into the info (information) 
rich and the info poor. And that divide does exist today. My wife and I 
lectured about this looming danger twenty years ago. What was less 
visible then, however, were the new, positive forces that work against 
the digital divide. There are reasons to be optimistic. 
   There are technological reasons to hope the digital divide will 
narrow. As the Internet becomes more and more commercialized, it is in 
the interest of business to universalize access -- after all, the more 
people online, the more potential customers there are. More and more 
governments, afraid their countries will be left behind, want to spread 
Internet access. Within the next decade or two, one to two billion 
people on the planet will be netted together. As a result, I now believe 
the digital divide will narrow rather than widen in the years ahead. And 
that is very good news because the Internet may well be the most 
powerful tool for combating world poverty that we‘ve ever had. 
   Of course, the use of the Internet isn‘t the only way to defeat 
poverty. And the Internet is not the only tool we have. But it has 
enormous potential. 
   To take advantage of this tool, some impoverished countries will 
have to get over their outdated anti-colonial prejudices with respect to 
foreign investment. Countries that still think foreign investment is an 
invasion of their sovereignty might well study the history of 
infrastructure (the basic structural foundations of a society) in the 
United States. When the 
   217 
   United States built its industrial infrastructure, it didn‘t have 
the capital to do so. And that is why America‘s Second Wave 
infrastructure -- including roads, harbors, highways, ports and so on -- 
   were built with foreign investment. The English, the Germans, the 
Dutch and the French were investing in Britain‘s former colony. They 
financed them. Immigrant Americans built them. 
   Guess who owns them now? The Americans. I believe the same thing 
would be true in places like Brazil or anywhere else for that matter. 
The more foreign capital you have helping you build your Third Wave 
infrastructure, which today is an electronic infrastructure, the better 
off you‘re 
   going to be. That doesn‘t mean lying down and becoming fooled, or 
letting foreign corporations run uncontrolled. But it does mean 
recognizing how important they can be in building the energy and telecom 
infrastructures needed to take full advantage of the Internet. 55. 
Digital divide is something ________. 
   [A] getting worse because of the Internet 
   [B] the rich countries are responsible for 
   [C] the world must guard against 
   [D] considered positive today 
   56. Governments attach importance to the Internet because it 
________. 
   [A] offers economic potentials 
   [B] can bring foreign funds 
   [C] can soon wipe out world poverty 
   [D] connects people all over the world 
   57. The writer mentioned the case of the United States to justify 
the policy of ________. 
   [A] providing financial support overseas 
   [B] preventing foreign capital‘s control 
   [C] building industrial infrastructure

   58. It seems that now a country‘s economy depends much on ________. 
   [A] how well-developed it is electronically 
   [B] whether it is prejudiced against immigrants 
   [C] whether it adopts America‘s industrial pattern 
   [D] how much control it has over foreign corporations

   Why do so many Americans distrust what they read in their newspapers? 
The American Society of Newspaper Editors is trying to answer this 
painful question. The organization is deep into a long self-analysis 
known as the journalism credibility project. 
   Sad to say, this project has turned out to be mostly low-level 
findings about factual errors 
   218 
   and spelling and grammar mistakes, combined with lots of head-
scratching puzzlement about what in the world those readers really want. 
   But the sources of distrust go way deeper. Most journalists learn to 
see the world through a set of standard templates (patterns) into which 
they plug each day‘s events. In other words, there is a conventional 
story line in the newsroom culture that provides a backbone and a ready-
made narrative structure for otherwise confusing news. 
   There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists 
and their readers, which helps explain why the Dstandard templates‖ of 
the newsroom seem alien to many readers. In a recent survey, 
questionnaires were sent to reporters in five middle-size cities around 
the country, plus one large metropolitan area. Then residents in these 
communities were phoned at random and asked the same questions. 
   Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are 
more likely to live in upscale neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedeses, 
and trade stocks, and they‘re less likely to go to church, do volunteer 
work, or put down roots in a community. 
   Reporters tend to be part of a broadly defined social and cultural 
elite, so their work tends to reflect the conventional values of this 
elite. The astonishing distrust of the news media isn‘t rooted in 
inaccuracy or poor reportorial skills but in the daily clash of world 
views between reporters and their readers. 
   This is an explosive situation for any industry, particularly a 
declining one. Here is a troubled business that keeps hiring employees 
whose attitudes vastly annoy the customers. Then it sponsors lots of 
symposiums and a credibility project dedicated to wondering why 
customers are annoyed and fleeing in large numbers. But it never seems 
to get around to noticing the cultural and class biases that so many 
former buyers are complaining about. If it did, it would open up its 
diversity program, now focused narrowly on race and gender, and look for 
reporters who differ broadly by outlook, values, education, and class. 
   59. What is the passage mainly about? 
   [A] needs of the readers all over the world 
   [B] causes of the public disappointment about newspapers 
   [C] origins of the declining newspaper industry 
   [D] aims of a journalism credibility project 
   60. The results of the journalism credibility project turned out to 
be ________. 
   [A] quite trustworthy 
   [B] somewhat contradictory 
   [C] very illuminating 
   [D] rather superficial 
   61. The basic problem of journalists as pointed out by the writer 
lies in their ________. 
   [A] working attitude 
   [B] conventional lifestyle 
   219 
   [C] world outlook 
   [D] educational background 
   62. Despite its efforts, the newspaper industry still cannot satisfy 
the readers owing to its 
   ________. 
   [A] failure to realize its real problem 
   [B] tendency to hire annoying reporters 
   [C] likeliness to do inaccurate reporting 
   [D] prejudice in matters of race and gender

   The world is going through the biggest wave of mergers and 
acquisitions ever witnessed. The process sweeps from hyperactive America 
to Europe and reaches the emerging countries with unsurpassed might. 
Many in these countries are looking at this process and 
worrying: DWon‘t the wave of business concentration turn into an 
uncontrollable anti-competitive force?‖ 
   There‘s no question that the big are getting bigger and more 
powerful. Multinational corporations accounted for less than 20% of 
international trade in 1982. Today the figure is more than 25% and 
growing rapidly. International affiliates account for a fast-growing 
segment of production in economies that open up and welcome foreign 
investment. In Argentina, for instance, after the reforms of the early 
1990s, multinationals went from 43% to almost 70% of the industrial 
production of the 200 largest firms. This phenomenon has created serious 
concerns over the role of smaller economic firms, of national 
businessmen and over the ultimate stability of the world economy. 
   I believe that the most important forces behind the massive M&A wave 
are the same that underlie the globalization process: falling 
transportation and communication costs, lower trade and investment 
barriers and enlarged markets that require enlarged operations capable 
of meeting customer‘s demands. All these are beneficial, not 
detrimental, to consumers. As productivity grows, the world‘s wealth 
increases. 
   Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are 
scanty. Yet it is hard to imagine that the merger of a few oil firms 
today could re-create the same threats to competition that were feared 
nearly a century ago in the U.S., when the Standard Oil Trust was broken 
up. The mergers of telecom companies, such as WorldCom, hardly seem to 
bring higher prices for consumers or a reduction in the pace of 
technical progress. On the contrary, the price of communications is 
coming down fast. In cars, too, concentration is increasing -- witness 
Daimler and Chrysler, Renault and Nissan -- but it does not appear that 
consumers are being hurt. 
   Yet the fact remains that the merger movement must be watched. A few 
weeks ago, Alan Greenspan warned against the megamergers in the banking 
industry. Who is going to supervise, regulate and operate as lender of 
last resort with the gigantic banks that are being created? Won‘t 
   multinationals shift production from one place to another when a 
nation gets too strict about infringements to fair competition? And 
should one country take upon itself the role of Ddefending 
competition‖ on issues that affect many other nations, as in the U.S. 
vs. Microsoft case? 
   220 
   63. What is the typical trend of businesses today? 
   [A] to take in more foreign funds 
   [B] to invest more abroad 
   [C] to combine and become bigger 
   [D] to trade with more countries 
   64. According to the author, one of the driving forces behind M&A 
wave is ________. 
   [A] the greater customer demands 
   [B] a surplus supply for the market 
   [C] a growing productivity 
   [D] the increase of the world‘s wealth 
   65. From Paragraph 4 we can infer that ________. 
   [A] the increasing concentration is certain to hurt consumers 
   [B] WorldCom serves as a good example of both benefits and costs 
   [C] the costs of the globalization process are enormous 
   [D] the Standard Oil Trust might have threatened competition 
   66. Toward the new business wave, the writer‘s attitude can be said 
to be ________. 
   [A] optimistic 
   [B] objective 
   [C] pessimistic 
   [D] biased 
   Text 5 
   When I decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to 
me that I might become a part of a new international trend. A lateral 
move that hurt my pride and blocked my professional progress prompted me 
to abandon my relatively high profile career although, in the manner of 
a disgraced government minister, I covered my exit by claiming DI 
wanted to spend more time with my family‖. 
   Curiously, some two-and-a-half years and two novels later, my 
experiment in what the Americans term Ddownshifting‖ has turned my 
tired excuse into an absolute reality. I have been transformed from a 
passionate advocate of the philosophy of Dhaving it all,‖ preached by 
Linda Kelsey for the past seven years in the page of She magazine, into 
a woman who is happy to settle 
   for a bit of everything. 
   I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized 
resignation from the editorship of She after a build-up of stress, that 
abandoning the doctrine of Djuggling your life,‖ 
   221 
   and making the alternative move into Ddownshifting‖ brings with it 
far greater rewards than financial success and social status. Nothing 
could persuade me to return to the kind of life Kelsey used to advocate 
and I once enjoyed: 12-hour working days, pressured deadlines, the 
fearful strain of office politics and the limitations of being a parent 
on Dquality time‖. 
   In America, the move away from juggling to a simpler, less 
materialistic lifestyle is a well-established trend. Downshifting -- 
also known in America as Dvoluntary simplicity‖ -- has, 
   ironically, even bred a new area of what might be termed anti-
consumerism. There are a number of best-selling downshifting self-help 
books for people who want to simplify their lives; there are newsletters, 
such as The Tightwad Gazette, that give hundreds of thousands of 
Americans useful 
   tips on anything from recycling their cling-film to making their own 
soap; there are even support groups for those who want to achieve the 
mid-‘90s equivalent of dropping out. 
   While in America the trend started as a reaction to the economic 
decline -- after the mass redundancies caused by downsizing in the late 
‘80s -- and is still linked to the politics of thrift, in Britain, at 
least among the middle-class downshifters of my acquaintance, we have 
different reasons for seeking to simplify our lives. 
   For the women of my generation who were urged to keep juggling 
through the ‘80s, downshifting in the mid-‘90s is not so much a search 
for the mythical good life -- growing your 
   own organic vegetables, and risking turning into one -- as a 
personal recognition of your limitations. 
   67. Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 1? 
   [A] Full-time employment is a new international trend. 
   [B] The writer was compelled by circumstances to leave her job. 
   [C] DA lateral move‖ means stepping out of full-time employment. 
   [D] The writer was only too eager to spend more time with her family. 
   68. The writer‘s experiment shows that downshifting ________. 
   [A] enables her to realize her dream 
   [B] helps her mold a new philosophy of life 
   [C] prompts her to abandon her high social status 
   [D] leads her to accept the doctrine of She magazine 
   69. DJuggling one‘s life‖ probably means living a life 
characterized by ________. 
   [A] non-materialistic lifestyle 
   [B] a bit of everything 
   [C] extreme stress 
   [D] anti-consumerism 
   70. According to the passage, downshifting emerged in the U.S. as a 
result of ________. 
   [A] the quick pace of modern life 
   222 
   [B] man‘s adventurous spirit 
   [C] man‘s search for mythical experiences 
   [D] the economic situation

   In less than 30 years‘ time the Star Trek holodeck will be a 
reality. Direct links between the 
   brain‘s nervous system and a computer will also create full sensory 
virtual environments, 
   allowing virtual vacations like those in the film Total Recall. 
   71) There will be television chat shows hosted by robots, and cars 
with pollution monitors that will disable them when they offend. 72) 
Children will play with dolls equipped with 
   personality chips, computers with in-built personalities will be 
regarded as workmates rather than tools, relaxation will be in front of 
smell-television, and digital age will have arrived. 
   According to BT‘s futurologist, Ian Pearson, these are among the 
developments scheduled 
   for the first few decades of the new millennium (a period of 1,000 
years), when supercomputers will dramatically accelerate progress in all 
areas of life. 
   73) Pearson has pieced together the work of hundreds of researchers 
around the world to produce a unique millennium technology calendar that 
gives the latest dates when we can expect hundreds of key breakthroughs 
and discoveries to take place. Some of the biggest developments 
   will be in medicine, including an extended life expectancy and 
dozens of artificial organs coming into use between now and 2040. 
   Pearson also predicts a breakthrough in computer-human links. DBy 
linking directly to our 
   nervous system, computers could pick up what we feel and, hopefully, 
simulate feeling too so that we can start to develop full sensory 
environments, rather like the holidays in Total Recall or 
   the Star Trek holodeck,‖ he says. 74) But that, Pearson points out, 
is only the start of 
   man-machine integration: DIt will be the beginning of the long 
process of integration that will 
   ultimately lead to a fully electronic human before the end of the 
next century.‖ 
   Through his research, Pearson is able to put dates to most of the 
breakthroughs that can be predicted. However, there are still no 
forecasts for when faster-than-light travel will be available, or when 
human cloning will be perfected, or when time travel will be possible. 
But he does expect social problems as a result of technological advances. 
A boom in neighborhood surveillance cameras will, for example, cause 
problems in 2010, while the arrival of synthetic lifelike robots will 
mean people may not be able to distinguish between their human friends 
and the droids. 75) And home appliances will also become so smart that 
controlling and operating them will result in the breakout of a new 
psychological disorder -- kitchen rage.

   A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, 
but, if properly handled, it may become a driving force. When the United 
States entered just such a glowing period after the end of the Second 
World War, it had a market eight times larger than any competitor, 
giving its industries unparalleled economies of scale. Its scientists 
were the world‘s best, its workers the most skilled. America and 
Americans were prosperous beyond the dreams of the Europeans and Asians 
whose economies the war had destroyed. 
   It was inevitable that this primacy should have narrowed as other 
countries grew richer. Just as inevitably, the retreat from predominance 
proved painful. By the mid-1980s Americans had found themselves at a 
loss over their fading industrial competitiveness. Some huge American 
industries, such as consumer electronics, had shrunk or vanished in the 
face of foreign 
   234 
   competition. By 1987 there was only one American television maker 
left, Zenith. (Now there is none: Zenith was bought by South Korea‘s LG 
Electronics in July.) Foreign-made cars and 
   textiles were sweeping into the domestic market. America‘s machine-
tool industry was on the 
   ropes. For a while it looked as though the making of semiconductors, 
which America had invented and which sat at the heart of the new 
computer age, was going to be the next casualty. 
   All of this caused a crisis of confidence. Americans stopped taking 
prosperity for granted. They began to believe that their way of doing 
business was failing, and that their incomes would therefore shortly 
begin to fall as well. The mid-1980s brought one inquiry after another 
into the causes of America‘s industrial decline. Their sometimes 
sensational findings were filled with warnings about the growing 
competition from overseas. 
   How things have changed! In 1995 the United States can look back on 
five years of solid growth while Japan has been struggling. Few 
Americans attribute this solely to such obvious causes as a devalued 
dollar or the turning of the business cycle. Self-doubt has yielded to 
blind pride. DAmerican industry has changed its structure, has gone on 
a diet, has learnt to be more quick-witted,‖ according to Richard 
Cavanagh, executive dean of Harvard‘s Kennedy School of 
Government. DIt makes me proud to be an American just to see how our 
businesses are 
   improving their productivity,‖ says Stephen Moore of the Cato 
Institute, a think-tank in 
   Washington, DC. And William Sahlman of the Harvard Business School 
believes that people will look back on this period as Da golden age of 
business management in the United States.‖ 
   51. The U.S. achieved its predominance after World War II because 
________. 
   [A] it had made painstaking efforts towards this goal 
   [B] its domestic market was eight times larger than before 
   [C] the war had destroyed the economies of most potential 
competitors 
   [D] the unparalleled size of its workforce had given an impetus to 
its economy 52. The loss of U.S. predominance in the world economy in 
the 1980s is manifested in the fact 
   that the American ________. 
   [A] TV industry had withdrawn to its domestic market 
   [B] semiconductor industry had been taken over by foreign 
enterprises 
   [C] machine-tool industry had collapsed after suicidal actions 
   [D] auto industry had lost part of its domestic market 
   53. What can be inferred from the passage? 
   [A] It is human nature to shift between self-doubt and blind pride. 
   [B] Intense competition may contribute to economic progress. 
   [C] The revival of the economy depends on international cooperation. 
   [D] A long history of success may pave the way for further 
development. 
   54. The author seems to believe the revival of the U.S. economy in 
the 1990s can be attributed

   Being a man has always been dangerous. There are about 105 males 
born for every 100 females, but this ratio drops to near balance at the 
age of maturity, and among 70-year-olds there are twice as many women as 
men. But the great universal of male mortality is being changed. Now, 
boy babies survive almost as well as girls do. This means that, for the 
first time, there will be an excess of boys in those crucial years when 
they are searching for a mate. More important, another chance for 
natural selection has been removed. Fifty years ago, the chance of a 
baby (particularly a boy baby) surviving depended on its weight. A 
kilogram too light or too heavy meant almost certain death. Today it 
makes almost no difference. Since much of the variation is due to genes, 
one more agent of evolution has gone. 
   There is another way to commit evolutionary suicide: stay alive, but 
have fewer children. Few people are as fertile as in the past. Except in 
some religious communities, very few women have 15 children. Nowadays 
the number of births, like the age of death, has become average. Most of 
us have roughly the same number of offspring. Again, differences between 
people and the opportunity for natural selection to take advantage of it 
have diminished. India shows what is happening. The country offers 
wealth for a few in the great cities and poverty for the remaining 
tribal peoples. The grand mediocrity of today -- everyone being the same 
in survival and number of offspring -- means that natural selection has 
lost 80% of its power in upper-middle-class India compared to the tribes. 
   For us, this means that evolution is over; the biological Utopia has 
arrived. Strangely, it has involved little physical change. No other 
species fills so many places in nature. But in the pass 100,000 years -- 
even the pass 100 years -- our lives have been transformed but our 
bodies have not. We did not evolve, because machines and society did it 
for us. Darwin had a phrase to describe those ignorant of evolution: 
they Dlook at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, 
   as at something wholly beyond his comprehension.‖ No doubt we will 
remember a 20th century way of life beyond comprehension for its 
ugliness. But however amazed our descendants may be at how far from 
Utopia we were, they will look just like us. 
   55. What used to be the danger in being a man according to the first 
paragraph? 
   [A] A lack of mates. 
   [B] A fierce competition. 
   [C] A lower survival rate. 
   [D] A defective gene. 
   56. What does the example of India illustrate? 
   [A] Wealthy people tend to have fewer children than poor people. 
   236 
   [B] Natural selection hardly works among the rich and the poor. 
   [C] The middle class population is 80% smaller than that of the 
tribes. 
   [D] India is one of the countries with a very high birth rate. 
   57. The author argues that our bodies have stopped evolving because 
________. 
   [A] life has been improved by technological advance 
   [B] the number of female babies has been declining 
   [C] our species has reached the highest stage of evolution 
   [D] the difference between wealth and poverty is disappearing 
   58. Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? 
   [A] Sex Ratio Changes in Human Evolution 
   [B] Ways of Continuing Man‘s Evolution 
   [C] The Evolutionary Future of Nature 
   [D] Human Evolution Going Nowhere

   When a new movement in art attains a certain fashion, it is 
advisable to find out what its advocates are aiming at, for, however 
farfetched and unreasonable their principles may seem today, it is 
possible that in years to come they may be regarded as normal. With 
regard to Futurist poetry, however, the case is rather difficult, for 
whatever Futurist poetry may be -- even admitting that the theory on 
which it is based may be right -- it can hardly be classed as Literature. 
   This, in brief, is what the Futurist says; for a century, past 
conditions of life have been conditionally speeding up, till now we live 
in a world of noise and violence and speed. Consequently, our feelings, 
thoughts and emotions have undergone a corresponding change. This 
speeding up of life, says the Futurist, requires a new form of 
expression. We must speed up our literature too, if we want to interpret 
modern stress. We must pour out a large stream of essential words, 
unhampered by stops, or qualifying adjectives, or finite verbs. Instead 
of describing sounds we must make up words that imitate them; we must 
use many sizes of type and different colored inks on the same page, and 
shorten or lengthen words at will. 
   Certainly their descriptions of battles are confused. But it is a 
little upsetting to read in the explanatory notes that a certain line 
describes a fight between a Turkish and a Bulgarian officer on a bridge 
off which they both fall into the river -- and then to find that the 
line consists of the noise of their falling and the weights of the 
officers: DPluff! Pluff! A hundred and eighty-five 
   kilograms.‖ 
   This, though it fulfills the laws and requirements of Futurist 
poetry, can hardly be classed as Literature. All the same, no thinking 
man can refuse to accept their first proposition: that a great change in 
our emotional life calls for a change of expression. The whole question 
is really this: have we essentially changed? 
   237 
   59. This passage is mainly ________. 
   [A] a survey of new approaches to art 
   [B] a review of Futurist poetry 
   [C] about merits of the Futurist movement 
   [D] about laws and requirements of literature 
   60. When a novel literary idea appears, people should try to 
________. 
   [A] determine its purposes 
   [B] ignore its flaws 
   [C] follow the new fashions 
   [D] accept the principles 
   61. Futurists claim that we must ________. 
   [A] increase the production of literature 
   [B] use poetry to relieve modern stress 
   [C] develop new modes of expression 
   [D] avoid using adjectives and verbs 
   62. The author believes that Futurist poetry is ________. 
   [A] based on reasonable principles 
   [B] new and acceptable to ordinary people 
   [C] indicative of basic change in human nature 
   [D] more of a transient phenomenon than literature

   Aimlessness has hardly been typical of the postwar Japan whose 
productivity and social harmony are the envy of the United States and 
Europe. But increasingly the Japanese are seeing a decline of the 
traditional work-moral values. Ten years ago young people were 
hardworking and saw their jobs as their primary reason for being, but 
now Japan has largely fulfilled its economic needs, and young people 
don‘t know where they should go next. 
   The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women 
into the male-dominated job market have limited the opportunities of 
teenagers who are already questioning the heavy personal sacrifices 
involved in climbing Japan‘s rigid social ladder to good schools and 
jobs. In a recent survey, it was found that only 24.5 percent of 
Japanese students were fully satisfied with school life, compared with 
67.2 percent of students in the United States. In addition, far more 
Japanese workers expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs than did 
their counterparts in the 10 other countries surveyed. 
   While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, 
Japanese education tends to stress test taking and mechanical learning 
over creativity and self-expression. DThose things 
   238 
   that do not show up in the test scores -- personality, ability, 
courage or humanity -- are completely ignored,‖ says Toshiki Kaifu, 
chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party‘s education 
committee. DFrustration against this kind of thing leads kids to drop 
out and run wild.‖ Last year Japan experienced 2,125 incidents of 
school violence, including 929 assaults on teachers. Amid the outcry, 
many conservative leaders are seeking a return to the prewar emphasis on 
moral education. Last year Mitsuo Setoyama, who was then education 
minister, raised eyebrows when he argued that liberal reforms introduced 
by the American occupation authorities after World War II had weakened 
the DJapanese morality of respect for parents.‖ 
   But that may have more to do with Japanese life-styles. DIn 
Japan,‖ says educator Yoko 
   Muro, Dit‘s never a question of whether you enjoy your job and 
your life, but only how much you can endure.‖ With economic growth has 
come centralization; fully 76 percent of Japan‘s 119 million citizens 
live in cities where community and the extended family have been 
abandoned in favor of isolated, two-generation households. Urban 
Japanese have long endured lengthy commutes (travels to and from work) 
and crowded living conditions, but as the old group and family values 
weaken, the discomfort is beginning to tell. In the past decade, the 
Japanese divorce rate, while still well below that of the United States, 
has increased by more than 50 percent, and suicides have increased by 
nearly one-quarter. 
   63. In the Westerner‘s eyes, the postwar Japan was ________. 
   [A] under aimless development 
   [B] a positive example 
   [C] a rival to the West 
   [D] on the decline 
   64. According to the author, what may chiefly be responsible for the 
moral decline of Japanese 
   society? 
   [A] Women‘s participation in social activities is limited. 
   [B] More workers are dissatisfied with their jobs. 
   [C] Excessive emphasis has been placed on the basics. 
   [D] The life-style has been influenced by Western values. 
   65. Which of the following is true according to the author? 
   [A] Japanese education is praised for helping the young climb the 
social ladder. 
   [B] Japanese education is characterized by mechanical learning as 
well as creativity. 
   [C] More stress should be placed on the cultivation of creativity. 
   [D] Dropping out leads to frustration against test taking. 
   66. The change in Japanese life-style is revealed in the fact that 
________. 
   [A] the young are less tolerant of discomforts in life 
   [B] the divorce rate in Japan exceeds that in the U.S. 
   239 
   [C] the Japanese endure more than ever before 
   [D] the Japanese appreciate their present life 
   Text 5 
   If ambition is to be well regarded, the rewards of ambition -- 
wealth, distinction, control over one‘s destiny -- must be deemed 
worthy of the sacrifices made on ambition‘s behalf. If the tradition of 
ambition is to have vitality, it must be widely shared; and it 
especially must be highly regarded by people who are themselves admired, 
the educated not least among them. In an odd way, however, it is the 
educated who have claimed to have given up on ambition as an ideal. What 
is odd is that they have perhaps most benefited from ambition -- if not 
always their own then that of their parents and grandparents. There is 
heavy note of hypocrisy in this, a case of closing the barn door after 
the horses have escaped -- with the educated themselves riding on them. 
   Certainly people do not seem less interested in success and its 
signs now than formerly. Summer homes, European travel, BMWs -- the 
locations, place names and name brands may change, but such items do not 
seem less in demand today than a decade or two years ago. What has 
happened is that people cannot confess fully to their dreams, as easily 
and openly as once they could, lest they be thought pushing, acquisitive 
and vulgar. Instead, we are treated to fine hypocritical spectacles, 
which now more than ever seem in ample supply: the critic of American 
materialism with a Southampton summer home; the publisher of radical 
books who takes his meals in three-star restaurants; the journalist 
advocating participatory democracy in all phases of life, whose own 
children are enrolled in private schools. For such people and many more 
perhaps not so exceptional, the proper formulation is, DSucceed at all 
costs but avoid appearing ambitious.‖ 
   The attacks on ambition are many and come from various angles; its 
public defenders are few and unimpressive, where they are not extremely 
unattractive. As a result, the support for ambition as a healthy impulse, 
a quality to be admired and fixed in the mind of the young, is probably 
lower than it has ever been in the United States. This does not mean 
that ambition is at an end, that people no longer feel its stirrings and 
promptings, but only that, no longer openly honored, it is less openly 
professed. Consequences follow from this, of course, some of which are 
that ambition is driven underground, or made sly. Such, then, is the way 
things stand: on the left angry critics, on the right stupid supporters, 
and in the middle, as usual, the majority of earnest people trying to 
get on in life. 
   67. It is generally believed that ambition may be well regarded if 
________. 
   [A] its returns well compensate for the sacrifices 
   [B] it is rewarded with money, fame and power 
   [C] its goals are spiritual rather than material 
   [D] it is shared by the rich and the famous 
   68. The last sentence of the first paragraph most probably implies 
that it is ________. 
   [A] customary of the educated to discard ambition in words 
   240 
   [B] too late to check ambition once it has been let out 
   [C] dishonest to deny ambition after the fulfillment of the goal 
   [D] impractical for the educated to enjoy benefits from ambition 
   69. Some people do not openly admit they have ambition because 
________. 
   [A] they think of it as immoral 
   [B] their pursuits are not fame or wealth 
   [C] ambition is not closely related to material benefits 
   [D] they do not want to appear greedy and contemptible 
   70. From the last paragraph the conclusion can be drawn that 
ambition should be maintained 
   ________. 
   [A] secretly and vigorously 
   [B] openly and enthusiastically 
   [C] easily and momentarily 
   [D] verbally and spiritually

   Directions:

clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points) 
   Governments throughout the world act on the assumption that the 
welfare of their people depends largely on the economic strength and 
wealth of the community. 71) Under modern conditions, this requires 
varying measures of centralized control and hence the help of 
specialized scientists such as economists and operational research 
experts. 72) Furthermore, it is 
   obvious that the strength of a country‘s economy is directly bound 
up with the efficiency of its agriculture and industry, and that this in 
turn rests upon the efforts of scientists and technologists of all kinds. 
It also means that governments are increasingly compelled to interfere 
in these sectors in order to step up production and ensure that it is 
utilized to the best advantage. For example, they may encourage research 
in various ways, including the setting up of their own research centers; 
they may alter the structure of education, or interfere in order to 
reduce the wastage of natural resources or tap resources hitherto 
unexploited; or they may cooperate directly in the growing number of 
international projects related to science, economics and industry. In 
any case, all such interventions are heavily dependent on scientific 
advice and also scientific and technological manpower of all kinds. 
   73) Owing to the remarkable development in mass-communications, 
people everywhere are feeling new wants and are being exposed to new 
customs and ideas, while governments are often forced to introduce still 
further innovations for the reasons given above. At the same time, the 
   normal rate of social change throughout the world is taking place at 
a vastly accelerated speed compared with the past. For example, 74) in 
the early industrialized countries of Europe the 
   241 
   process of industrialization -- with all the far-reaching changes in 
social patterns that followed -- 
   was spread over nearly a century, whereas nowadays a developing 
nation may undergo the same process in a decade or so. All this has the 
effect of building up unusual pressures and tensions within the 
community and consequently presents serious problems for the governments 
concerned. 75) Additional social stresses may also occur because of the 
population explosion or problems arising from mass migration movements -
- themselves made relatively easy nowadays by modern means of transport. 
As a result of all these factors, governments are becoming 
   increasingly dependent on biologists and social scientists for 
planning the appropriate programs and putting them into effect.

   It‘s a rough world out there. Step outside and you could break a 
leg slipping on your doormat. Light up the stove and you could burn down 
the house. Luckily, if the doormat or stove failed to warn of coming 
disaster, a successful lawsuit might compensate you for your troubles. 
Or so the thinking has gone since the early 1980s, when juries began 
holding more companies liable for their customers‘ misfortunes. 
   Feeling threatened, companies responded by writing ever-longer 
warning labels, trying to anticipate every possible accident. Today, 
stepladders carry labels several inches long that warn, among other 
things, that you might -- surprise! -- fall off. The label on a child‘s 
Batman cape 
   cautions that the toy Ddoes not enable user to fly.‖ 
   While warnings are often appropriate and necessary -- the dangers of 
drug interactions, for example -- and many are required by state or 
federal regulations, it isn‘t clear that they actually protect the 
manufacturers and sellers from liability if a customer is injured. About 
50 percent of the companies lose when injured customers take them to 
court. 
   Now the tide appears to be turning. As personal injury claims 
continue as before, some courts are beginning to side with defendants, 
especially in cases where a warning label probably wouldn‘t have 
changed anything. In May, Julie Nimmons, president of Schutt Sports in 
Illinois, successfully fought a lawsuit involving a football player who 
was paralyzed in a game while wearing a Schutt helmet. DWe‘re really 
sorry he has become paralyzed, but helmets aren‘t designed to prevent 
those kinds of injuries,‖ says Nimmons. The jury agreed that the nature 
of 
   the game, not the helmet, was the reason for the athlete‘s injury. 
At the same time, the American Law Institute -- a group of judges, 
lawyers, and academics whose recommendations carry substantial weight -- 
issued new guidelines for tort law stating that companies need not warn 
customers of obvious dangers or bombard them with a lengthy list of 
possible ones. DImportant information can get buried in a sea of 
trivialities,‖ says a law professor at Cornell law School who helped 
draft the new guidelines. If the moderate end of the legal community has 
its way, the information on products might actually be provided for the 
benefit of customers and not as protection against legal liability. 
   51. What were things like in 1980s when accidents happened? 
   [A] Customers might be relieved of their disasters through lawsuits. 
   [B] Injured customers could expect protection from the legal system. 
   252 
   [C] Companies would avoid being sued by providing new warnings. 
   [D] Juries tended to find fault with the compensations companies 
promised. 52. Manufacturers as mentioned in the passage tend to ________. 
   [A] satisfy customers by writing long warnings on products 
   [B] become honest in describing the inadequacies of their products 
   [C] make the best use of labels to avoid legal liability 
   [D] feel obliged to view customers‘ safety as their first concern 
   53. The case of Schutt helmet demonstrated that ________. 
   [A] some injury claims were no longer supported by law 
   [B] helmets were not designed to prevent injuries 
   [C] product labels would eventually be discarded 
   [D] some sports games might lose popularity with athletes 
   54. The author‘s attitude towards the issue seems to be ________. 
   [A] biased 
   [B] indifferent 
   [C] puzzling 
   [D] objective

   In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has 
revolved around efforts to tap the consumer market. More recently, as 
the Web proved to be more than a fashion, companies have started to buy 
and sell products and services with one another. Such business-to-
business sales make sense because businesspeople typically know what 
product they‘re looking for. 
   Nonetheless, many companies still hesitate to use the Web because of 
doubts about its reliability. DBusinesses need to feel they can trust 
the pathway between them and the supplier,‖ says senior analyst Blane 
Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies are limiting the risk by 
conducting online transactions only with established business partners 
who are given access to the company‘s private intranet. 
   Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the 
technology available for marketing. Until recently, Internet marketing 
activities have focused on strategies to Dpull‖ customers into sites. 
In the past year, however, software companies have developed tools that 
allow companies to Dpush‖ information directly out to consumers, 
transmitting marketing messages directly to targeted customers. Most 
notably, the Pointcast Network uses a screen saver to deliver a 
continually updated stream of news and advertisements to 
subscribers‘ computer 
   monitors. Subscribers can customize the information they want to 
receive and proceed directly to 
   253 
   a company‘s Web site. Companies such as Virtual Vineyards are 
already starting to use similar technologies to push messages to 
customers about special sales, product offerings, or other events. But 
push technology has earned the contempt of many Web users. Online 
culture thinks highly of the notion that the information flowing onto 
the screen comes there by specific request. Once commercial promotion 
begins to fill the screen uninvited, the distinction between the Web and 
television fades. That‘s a prospect that horrifies Net purists. 
   But it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to 
resort to push strategies to make money. The examples of Virtual 
Vineyards, Amazon.com, and other pioneers show that a Web site selling 
the right kind of products with the right mix of interactivity, 
hospitality, and security will attract online customers. And the cost of 
computing power continues to free fall, which is a good sign for any 
enterprise setting up shop in silicon. People looking back 5 or 10 years 
from now may well wonder why so few companies took the online plunge. 55. 
We learn from the beginning of the passage that Web business ________. 
   [A] has been striving to expand its market 
   [B] intended to follow a fanciful fashion 
   [C] tried but in vain to control the market 
   [D] has been booming for one year or so 
   56. Speaking of the online technology available for marketing, the 
author implies that 
   ________. 
   [A] the technology is popular with many Web users 
   [B] businesses have faith in the reliability of online transactions 
   [C] there is a radical change in strategy 
   [D] it is accessible limitedly to established partners 
   57. In the view of Net purists, ________. 
   [A] there should be no marketing messages in online culture 
   [B] money making should be given priority to on the Web 
   [C] the Web should be able to function as the television set 
   [D] there should be no online commercial information without 
requests 
   58. We learn from the last paragraph that ________. 
   [A] pushing information on the Web is essential to Internet commerce 
   [B] interactivity, hospitality and security are important to online 
customers 
   [C] leading companies began to take the online plunge decades ago 
   [D] setting up shops in silicon is independent of the cost of 
computing power

   An invisible border divides those arguing for computers in the 
classroom on the behalf of students‘ career prospects and those arguing 
for computers in the classroom for broader reasons 
   of radical educational reform. Very few writers on the subject have 
explored this distinction -- indeed, contradiction -- which goes to the 
heart of what is wrong with the campaign to put computers in the 
classroom. 
   An education that aims at getting a student a certain kind of job is 
a technical education, justified for reasons radically different from 
why education is universally required by law. It is not simply to raise 
everyone‘s job prospects that all children are legally required to 
attend school 
   into their teens. Rather, we have a certain conception of the 
American citizen, a character who is incomplete if he cannot competently 
assess how his livelihood and happiness are affected by things outside 
of himself. But this was not always the case; before it was legally 
required for all children to attend school until a certain age, it was 
widely accepted that some were just not equipped by nature to pursue 
this kind of education. With optimism characteristic of all 
industrialized countries, we came to accept that everyone is fit to be 
educated. Computer-education advocates forsake this optimistic notion 
for a pessimism that betrays their otherwise cheery outlook. Banking on 
the confusion between educational and vocational reasons for bringing 
computers into schools, computered advocates often emphasize the job 
prospects of graduates over their educational achievement. 
   There are some good arguments for a technical education given the 
right kind of student. Many European schools introduce the concept of 
professional training early on in order to make sure children are 
properly equipped for the professions they want to join. It is, however, 
presumptuous to insist that there will only be so many jobs for so many 
scientists, so many businessmen, so many accountants. Besides, this is 
unlikely to produce the needed number of every kind of professional in a 
country as large as ours and where the economy is spread over so many 
states and involves so many international corporations. 
   But, for a small group of students, professional training might be 
the way to go since well-developed skills, all other factors being equal, 
can be the difference between having a job and not. Of course, the 
basics of using any computer these days are very simple. It does not 
take a lifelong acquaintance to pick up various software programs. If 
one wanted to become a computer engineer, that is, of course, an 
entirely different story. Basic computer skills take -- at the very 
longest -- a couple of months to learn. In any case, basic computer 
skills are only complementary to the host of real skills that are 
necessary to becoming any kind of professional. It should be observed, 
of course, that no school, vocational or not, is helped by a confusion 
over its purpose. 
   59. The author thinks the present rush to put computers in the 
classroom is ________. 
   [A] far-reaching 
   [B] dubiously oriented 
   [C] self-contradictory 
   [D] radically reformatory 
   255 
   60. The belief that education is indispensable to all children 
________. 
   [A] is indicative of a pessimism in disguise 
   [B] came into being along with the arrival of computers 
   [C] is deeply rooted in the minds of computered advocates 
   [D] originated from the optimistic attitude of industrialized 
countries 
   61. It could be inferred from the passage that in the author‘s 
country the European model of 
   professional training is ________. 
   [A] dependent upon the starting age of candidates 
   [B] worth trying in various social sections 
   [C] of little practical value 
   [D] attractive to every kind of professional 
   62. According to the author, basic computer skills should be 
________. 
   [A] included as an auxiliary course in school 
   [B] highlighted in acquisition of professional qualifications

   When a Scottish research team startled the world by revealing 3 
months ago that it had cloned an adult sheep, President Clinton moved 
swiftly. Declaring that he was opposed to using this unusual animal 
husbandry technique to clone humans, he ordered that federal funds not 
be used for such an experiment -- although no one had proposed to do so 
-- and asked an independent panel of experts chaired by Princeton 
President Harold Shapiro to report back to the White House in 90 days 
with recommendations for a national policy on human cloning. That group 
-- the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) -- has been working 
feverishly to put its wisdom on paper, and at a meeting on 17 May, 
members agreed on a near-final draft of their recommendations. 
   NBAC will ask that Clinton‘s 90-day ban on federal funds for human 
cloning be extended 
   indefinitely, and possibly that it be made law. But NBAC members are 
planning to word the recommendation narrowly to avoid new restrictions 
on research that involves the cloning of human DNA or cells -- routine 
in molecular biology. The panel has not yet reached agreement on a 
crucial question, however, whether to recommend legislation that would 
make it a crime for private funding to be used for human cloning. 
   In a draft preface to the recommendations, discussed at the 17 May 
meeting, Shapiro suggested that the panel had found a broad consensus 
that it would be Dmorally unacceptable to attempt to create a human 
child by adult nuclear cloning.‖ Shapiro explained during the meeting 
that the moral doubt stems mainly from fears about the risk to the 
health of the child. The panel then informally accepted several general 
conclusions, although some details have not been 
   256 
   settled. 
   NBAC plans to call for a continued ban on federal government funding 
for any attempt to clone body cell nuclei to create a child. Because 
current federal law already forbids the use of federal funds to create 
embryos (the earliest stage of human offspring before birth) for 
research or to knowingly endanger an embryo‘s life, NBAC will remain 
silent on embryo research. 
   NBAC members also indicated that they will appeal to privately 
funded researchers and clinics not to try to clone humans by body cell 
nuclear transfer. But they were divided on whether to go further by 
calling for a federal law that would impose a complete ban on human 
cloning. Shapiro and most members favored an appeal for such legislation, 
but in a phone interview, he said this issue was still Dup in the 
air.‖ 
   63. We can learn from the first paragraph that ________. 
   [A] federal funds have been used in a project to clone humans 
   [B] the White House responded strongly to the news of cloning 
   [C] NBAC was authorized to control the misuse of cloning technique 
   [D] the White House has got the panel‘s recommendations on cloning 
   64. The panel agreed on all of the following except that ________. 
   [A] the ban on federal funds for human cloning should be made a law 
   [B] the cloning of human DNA is not to be put under more control 
   [C] it is criminal to use private funding for human cloning 
   [D] it would be against ethical values to clone a human being 
   65. NBAC will leave the issue of embryo research undiscussed because 
________. 
   [A] embryo research is just a current development of cloning 
   [B] the health of the child is not the main concern of embryo 
research 
   [C] an embryo‘s life will not be endangered in embryo research 
   [D] the issue is explicitly stated and settled in the law 
   66. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that ________. 
   [A] some NBAC members hesitate to ban human cloning completely 
   [B] a law banning human cloning is to be passed in no time 
   [C] privately funded researchers will respond positively to NBAC‘s 
appeal 
   [D] the issue of human cloning will soon be settled

   Science, in practice, depends far less on the experiments it 
prepares than on the 
   257 
   preparedness of the minds of the men who watch the experiments. Sir 
Isaac Newton supposedly discovered gravity through the fall of an apple. 
Apples had been falling in many places for centuries and thousands of 
people had seen them fall. But Newton for years had been curious about 
the cause of the orbital motion of the moon and planets. What kept them 
in place? Why didn‘t they fall out of the sky? The fact that the apple 
fell down toward the earth and not up into the tree answered the 
question he had been asking himself about those larger fruits of the 
heavens, the moon and the planets. 
   How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple 
falling up into the tree? Newton did because he was not trying to 
predict anything. He was just wondering. His mind was ready for the 
unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of 
research. If you don‘t have unpredictable things, you don‘t have 
research. Scientists tend to forget this when writing their cut and 
dried reports for the technical journals, but history is filled with 
examples of it. 
   In talking to some scientists, particularly younger ones, you might 
gather the impression that they find the Dscientific method‖ a 
substitute for imaginative thought. I‘ve attended research conferences 
where a scientist has been asked what he thinks about the advisability 
of continuing a certain experiment. The scientist has frowned, looked at 
the graphs, and said Dthe data are still inconclusive.‖ DWe know 
that,‖ the men from the budget office have said, Dbut what do you 
think? Is it worthwhile going on? What do you think we might expect?‖ 
The scientist has been 
   shocked at having even been asked to speculate. 
   What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become 
the victim of his own writings. He has put forward unquestioned claims 
so consistently that he not only believes them himself, but has 
convinced industrial and business management that they are true. If 
experiments are planned and carried out according to plan as faithfully 
as the reports in the science journals indicate, then it is perfectly 
logical for management to expect research to produce results measurable 
in dollars and cents. It is entirely reasonable for auditors to believe 
that scientists who know exactly where they are going and how they will 
get there should not be distracted by the necessity of keeping one eye 
on the cash register while the other eye is on the microscope. Nor, if 
regularity and conformity to a standard pattern are as desirable to the 
scientist as the writing of his papers would appear to reflect, is 
management to be blamed for discriminating against the Dodd balls‖ 
among researchers in favor of more conventional thinkers who Dwork well 
with the team.‖ 
   67. The author wants to prove with the example of Isaac Newton that 
________. 
   [A] inquiring minds are more important than scientific experiments 
   [B] science advances when fruitful researches are conducted 
   [C] scientists seldom forget the essential nature of research 
   [D] unpredictability weighs less than prediction in scientific 
research 
   68. The author asserts that scientists ________. 
   [A] shouldn‘t replace Dscientific method‖ with imaginative 
thought 
   [B] shouldn‘t neglect to speculate on unpredictable things 
   258 
   [C] should write more concise reports for technical journals 
   [D] should be confident about their research findings 
   69. It seems that some young scientists ________. 
   [A] have a keen interest in prediction 
   [B] often speculate on the future 
   [C] think highly of creative thinking 
   [D] stick to Dscientific method‖ 
   70. The author implies that the results of scientific research 
________. 
   [A] may not be as profitable as they are expected 
   [B] can be measured in dollars and cents 
   [C] rely on conformity to a standard pattern 
   [D] are mostly underestimated by management

ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points) 
   71) While there are almost as many definitions of history as there 
are historians, modern practice most closely conforms to one that sees 
history as the attempt to recreate and explain the significant events of 
the past. Caught in the web of its own time and place, each generation 
of historians determines anew what is significant for it in the past. In 
this search the evidence found is always incomplete and scattered; it is 
also frequently partial or partisan. The irony of the historian‘s craft 
is that its practitioners always know that their efforts are but 
contributions to an unending process. 
   72) Interest in historical methods has arisen less through external 
challenge to the validity of history as an intellectual discipline and 
more from internal quarrels among historians themselves. 
   While history once revered its affinity to literature and philosophy, 
the emerging social sciences seemed to afford greater opportunities for 
asking new questions and providing rewarding approaches to an 
understanding of the past. Social science methodologies had to be 
adapted to a discipline governed by the primacy of historical sources 
rather than the imperatives of the contemporary world. 73) During this 
transfer, traditional historical methods were augmented by 
   additional methodologies designed to interpret the new forms of 
evidence in the historical study. 
   Methodology is a term that remains inherently ambiguous in the 
historical profession. 74) There is no agreement whether methodology 
refers to the concepts peculiar to historical work in general or to the 
research techniques appropriate to the various branches of historical 
inquiry. 
   Historians, especially those so blinded by their research interests 
that they have been accused of Dtunnel method,‖ frequently fall victim 
to the Dtechnicist fallacy.‖ Also common in the natural sciences, the 
technicist fallacy mistakenly identifies the discipline as a whole with 
certain parts 
   259 
   of its technical implementation. 
   75) It applies equally to traditional historians who view history as 
only the external and internal criticism of sources, and to social 
science historians who equate their activity with specific techniques.

   Until recently most historians spoke very critically of the 
Industrial Revolution. They 41 that in the long run industrialization 
greatly raised the standard of living for the 42 man. But they insisted 
that its 43 results during the period from 1750 to 1850 
   were widespread poverty and misery for the 44 of the English 
population. 45 
   contrast, they saw in the preceding hundred years from 1650 to 1750, 
when England was still a 46 agricultural country, a period of great 
abundance and prosperity. 
   This view, 47, is generally thought to be wrong. Specialists 48 
history and 
   economics, have 49 two things: that the period from 1650 to 1750 was 
50 by 
   great poverty, and that industrialization certainly did not worsen 
and may have actually improved the conditions for the majority of the 
populace.

   Text 1 
   Few creations of big technology capture the imagination like giant 
dams. Perhaps it is humankind‘s long suffering at the mercy of flood 
and drought that makes the idea of forcing the waters to do our bidding 
so fascinating. But to be fascinated is also, sometimes, to be blind. 
Several giant dam projects threaten to do more harm than good. 
   The lesson from dams is that big is not always beautiful. It 
doesn‘t help that building a big, powerful dam has become a symbol of 
achievement for nations and people striving to assert themselves. 
Egypt‘s leadership in the Arab world was cemented by the Aswan High Dam. 
   Turkey‘s bid for First World status includes the giant Ataturk Dam. 
   But big dams tend not to work as intended. The Aswan Dam, for 
example, stopped the Nile flooding but deprived Egypt of the fertile 
silt that floods left -- all in return for a giant reservoir of disease 
which is now so full of silt that it barely generates electricity. 
   And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists. This week, in 
the heart of civilized Europe, Slovaks and Hungarians stopped just short 
of sending in the troops in their contention over a dam on the Danube. 
The huge complex will probably have all the usual problems of big dams. 
But Slovakia is bidding for independence from the Czechs, and now needs 
a dam to prove itself. 
   Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has given the go-ahead to the 
even more wrong-headed Narmada Dam. And the bank has done this even 
though its advisors say the dam will cause hardship for the powerless 
and environmental destruction. The benefits are for the powerful, but 
they are far from guaranteed. 
   270 
   Proper, scientific study of the impacts of dams and of the cost and 
benefits of controlling water can help to resolve these conflicts. 
Hydroelectric power and flood control and irrigation are possible 
without building monster dams. But when you are dealing with myths, it 
is hard to be either proper, or scientific. It is time that the world 
learned the lessons of Aswan. You don‘t need a dam to be saved. 
   51. The third sentence of Paragraph 1 implies that ________.

   [D] fascination makes people lose their eyesight

   [B] dams without power stations

   53. What is the myth concerning giant dams? 
   [A] They bring in more fertile soil. 
   [B] They help defend the country.

   Well, no gain without pain, they say. But what about pain without 
gain? Everywhere you go in America, you hear tales of corporate revival. 
What is harder to establish is whether the productivity revolution that 
businessmen assume they are presiding over is for real. 
   The official statistics are mildly discouraging. They show that, if 
you lump manufacturing and services together, productivity has grown on 
average by 1.2% since 1987. That is somewhat faster than the average 
during the previous decade. And since 1991, productivity has increased 
by about 2% a year, which is more than twice the 1978-87 average. The 
trouble is that part of the recent acceleration is due to the usual 
rebound that occurs at this point in a business cycle, and so is not 
conclusive evidence of a revival in the underlying trend. There is, as 
Robert Rubin, the 
   271 
   treasury secretary, says, a Ddisjunction‖ between the mass of 
business anecdote that points to a leap in productivity and the picture 
reflected by the statistics. 
   Some of this can be easily explained. New ways of organizing the 
workplace -- all that re-engineering and downsizing -- are only one 
contribution to the overall productivity of an economy, which is driven 
by many other factors such as joint investment in equipment and 
machinery, new technology, and investment in education and training. 
Moreover, most of the changes that companies make are intended to keep 
them profitable, and this need not always mean increasing productivity: 
switching to new markets or improving quality can matter just as much. 
   Two other explanations are more speculative. First, some of the 
business restructuring of recent years may have been ineptly done. 
Second, even if it was well done, it may have spread much less widely 
than people suppose. 
   Leonard Schlesinger, a Harvard academic and former chief executive 
of Au Bong Pain, a rapidly growing chain of bakery cafes, says that 
much Dre-engineering‖ has been crude. In many 
   cases, he believes, the loss of revenue has been greater than the 
reductions in cost. His colleague, Michael Beer, says that far too many 
companies have applied re-engineering in a mechanistic fashion, chopping 
out costs without giving sufficient thought to long-term profitability. 
BBDO‘s 
   Al Rosenshine is blunter. He dismisses a lot of the work of re-
engineering consultants as mere rubbish -- Dthe worst sort of ambulance 
chasing.‖ 
   55. According to the author, the American economic situation is 
________. 
   [A] not as good as it seems 
   [B] at its turning point 
   [C] much better than it seems 
   [D] near to complete recovery 
   56. The official statistics on productivity growth ________. 
   [A] exclude the usual rebound in a business cycle 
   [B] fall short of businessmen‘s anticipation 
   [C] meet the expectation of business people 
   [D] fail to reflect the true state of economy 
   57. The author raises the question Dwhat about pain without gain?‖ 
because ________. 
   [A] he questions the truth of Dno gain without pain‖ 
   [B] he does not think the productivity revolution works 
   [C] he wonders if the official statistics are misleading 
   [D] he has conclusive evidence for the revival of businesses 
   58. Which of the following statements is NOT mentioned in the 
passage? 
   272 
   [A] Radical reforms are essential for the increase of productivity. 
   [B] New ways of organizing workplaces may help to increase 
productivity. 
   [C] The reduction of costs is not a sure way to gain long-term 
profitability. 
   [D] The consultants are a bunch of good-for-nothings. 
   Text 3 
   Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects of 
culture. Think of Gallileo’s 17th-century trial for his rebelling 
belief before the Catholic Church or poet William Blake‘s harsh remarks 
against the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton. The schism between 
   science and the humanities has, if anything, deepened in this 
century. 
   Until recently, the scientific community was so powerful that it 
could afford to ignore its critics -- but no longer. As funding for 
science has declined, scientists have attacked Danti-science‖ in 
several books, notably Higher Superstition, by Paul R. Gross, a 
biologist at the 
   University of Virginia, and Norman Levitt, a mathematician at 
Rutgers University; and The 
   Demon-Haunted World, by Carl Sagan of Cornell University. 
   Defenders of science have also voiced their concerns at meetings 
such as DThe Flight from 
   Science and Reason,‖ held in New York City in 1995, and DScience 
in the Age of (Mis) information,‖ which assembled last June near 
Buffalo. 
   Anti-science clearly means different things to different people. 
Gross and Levitt find fault primarily with sociologists, philosophers 
and other academics who have questioned science‘s objectivity. Sagan is 
more concerned with those who believe in ghosts, creationism and other 
phenomena that contradict the scientific worldview. 
   A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the anti-science tag 
has been attached to many other groups as well, from authorities who 
advocated the elimination of the last remaining stocks of smallpox virus 
to Republicans who advocated decreased funding for basic research. 
   Few would dispute that the term applies to the Unabomber, whose 
manifesto, published in 1995, scorns science and longs for return to a 
pre-technological utopia. But surely that does not mean 
environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are 
anti-science, as an essay in US News & World Report last May seemed to 
suggest. 
   The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true 
enemies of science, argues Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, a 
pioneer of environmental studies, are those who question the evidence 
supporting global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and other 
consequences of industrial growth. 
   Indeed, some observers fear that the anti-science epithet is in 
danger of becoming meaningless. DThe term ?anti-science‘ can lump

   Emerging from the 1980 census is the picture of a nation developing 
more and more regional competition, as population growth in the 
Northeast and Midwest reaches a near standstill. 
   This development -- and its strong implications for US politics and 
economy in years ahead -- has enthroned the South as America‘s most 
densely populated region for the first time in the history of the 
nation‘s head counting. 
   Altogether, the US population rose in the 1970s by 23.2 million 
people -- numerically the third-largest growth ever recorded in a single 
decade. Even so, that gain adds up to only 11.4 percent, lowest in 
American annual records except for the Depression years. 
   Americans have been migrating south and west in larger numbers since 
World War II, and the pattern still prevails. 
   Three sun-belt states -- Florida, Texas and California -- together 
had nearly 10 million more people in 1980 than a decade earlier. Among 
large cities, San Diego moved from 14th to 8th and San Antonio from 15th 
to 10th -- with Cleveland and Washington. D. C., dropping out of the top 
10. 
   Not all that shift can be attributed to the movement out of the snow 
belt, census officials say. 
   274 
   Nonstop waves of immigrants played a role, too -- and so did bigger 
crops of babies as yesterday‘s Dbaby boom‖ generation reached its 
child-bearing years. 
   Moreover, demographers see the continuing shift south and west as 
joined by a related but newer phenomenon: More and more, Americans 
apparently are looking not just for places with more jobs but with fewer 
people, too. Some instances― 
   ?Regionally, the Rocky Mountain states reported the most rapid 
growth rate -- 37.1 percent 
   since 1970 in a vast area with only 5 percent of the US population. 
   ?Among states, Nevada and Arizona grew fastest of all: 63.5 and 53.1 
percent respectively. Except for Florida and Texas, the top 10 in rate 
of growth is composed of Western states with 7.5 million people -- about 
9 per square mile. 
   The flight from overcrowdedness affects the migration from snow belt 
to more bearable climates. 
   Nowhere do 1980 census statistics dramatize more the American search 
for spacious living than in the Far West. There, California added 3.7 
million to its population in the 1970s, more than any other state. 
   In that decade, however, large numbers also migrated from California, 
mostly to other parts of the West. Often they chose -- and still are 
choosing -- somewhat colder climates such as Oregon, Idaho and Alaska in 
order to escape smog, crime and other plagues of urbanization in the 
Golden State. 
   As a result, California‘s growth rate dropped during the 1970s, to 
18.5 percent -- little more than two thirds the 1960s‘ growth figure 
and considerably below that of other Western states. 
   63. Discerned from the perplexing picture of population growth the 
1980 census provided, 
   America in 1970s ________. 
   [A] enjoyed the lowest net growth of population in history 
   [B] witnessed a southwestern shift of population 
   [C] underwent an unparalleled period of population growth 
   [D] brought to a standstill its pattern of migration since World War 
II 64. The census distinguished itself from previous studies on 
population movement in that 
   ________. 
   [A] it stresses the climatic influence on population distribution 
   [B] it highlights the contribution of continuous waves of immigrants 
   [C] it reveals the Americans‘ new pursuit of spacious living 
   [D] it elaborates the delayed effects of yesterday‘s Dbaby boom‖ 
   65. We can see from the available statistics that ________. 
   [A] California was once the most thinly populated area in the whole 
US 
   [B] the top 10 states in growth rate of population were all located 
in the West 
   [C] cities with better climates benefited unanimously from migration 
   275 
   [D] Arizona ranked second of all states in its growth rate of 
population 
   66. The word Ddemographers‖ (Line 1, Paragraph 8) most probably 
means ________. 
   [A] people in favor of the trend of democracy 
   [B] advocates of migration between states 
   [C] scientists engaged in the study of population 
   [D] conservatives clinging to old patterns of life 
   Text 5 
   Scattered around the globe are more than 100 small regions of 
isolated volcanic activity known to geologists as hot spots. Unlike most 
of the world‘s volcanoes, they are not always found at the boundaries 
of the great drifting plates that make up the earth‘s surface; on the 
contrary, many of them lie deep in the interior of a plate. Most of the 
hot spots move only slowly, and in some cases the movement of the plates 
past them has left trails of dead volcanoes. The hot spots and their 
volcanic trails are milestones that mark the passage of the plates. 
   That the plates are moving is now beyond dispute. Africa and South 
America, for example, are moving away from each other as new material is 
injected into the sea floor between them. The complementary coastlines 
and certain geological features that seem to span the ocean are 
reminders of where the two continents were once joined. The relative 
motion of the plates carrying these continents has been constructed in 
detail, but the motion of one plate with respect to another cannot 
readily be translated into motion with respect to the earth‘s interior. 
It is not 
   possible to determine whether both continents are moving in opposite 
directions or whether one continent is stationary and the other is 
drifting away from it. Hot spots, anchored in the deeper layers of the 
earth, provide the measuring instruments needed to resolve the question. 
From an analysis of the hot-spot population it appears that the African 
plate is stationary and that it has not moved during the past 30 million 
years. 
   The significance of hot spots is not confined to their role as a 
frame of reference. It now appears that they also have an important 
influence on the geophysical processes that propel the plates across the 
globe. When a continental plate come to rest over a hot spot, the 
material rising from deeper layers creates a broad dome. As the dome 
grows, it develops deep fissures (cracks); in at least a few cases the 
continent may break entirely along some of these fissures, so that the 
hot spot initiates the formation of a new ocean. Thus just as earlier 
theories have explained the mobility of the continents, so hot spots may 
explain their mutability (inconstancy). 67. The author believes that 
________. 
   [A] the motion of the plates corresponds to that of the earth‘s 
interior 
   [B] the geological theory about drifting plates has been proved to 
be true 
   [C] the hot spots and the plates move slowly in opposite directions 
   [D] the movement of hot spots proves the continents are moving apart 
   68. That Africa and South America were once joined can be deduced 
from the fact that 
   276 
   ________. 
   [A] the two continents are still moving in opposite directions 
   [B] they have been found to share certain geological features 
   [C] the African plate has been stable for 30 million years 
   [D] over 100 hot spots are scattered all around the globe 
   69. The hot spot theory may prove useful in explaining ________. 
   [A] the structure of the African plates 
   [B] the revival of dead volcanoes 
   [C] the mobility of the continents 
   [D] the formation of new oceans 
   70. The passage is mainly about ________. 
   [A] the features of volcanic activities 
   [B] the importance of the theory about drifting plates 
   [C] the significance of hot spots in geophysical studies 
   [D] the process of the formation of volcanoes

   They were, by far, the largest and most distant objects that 
scientists had ever detected: a strip of enormous cosmic clouds some 15 
billion light-years from earth. 71) But even more important, it was the 
farthest that scientists had been able to look into the past, for what 
they were seeing were the patterns and structures that existed 15 
billion years ago. That was just about 
   the moment that the universe was born. What the researchers found 
was at once both amazing and expected: the US National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration‘s Cosmic Background Explorer satellite -- Cobe -- 
had discovered landmark evidence that the universe did in fact begin 
with the primeval explosion that has become known as the Big Bang (the 
theory that the universe originated in an explosion from a single mass 
of energy). 
   72) The existence of the giant clouds was virtually required for the 
Big Bang, first put forward in the 1920s, to maintain its reign as the 
dominant explanation of the cosmos. According 
   to the theory, the universe burst into being as a submicroscopic, 
unimaginably dense knot of pure energy that flew outward in all 
directions, emitting radiation as it went, condensing into particles and 
then into atoms of gas. Over billions of years, the gas was compressed 
by gravity into galaxies, stars, plants and eventually, even humans. 
   Cobe is designed to see just the biggest structures, but astronomers 
would like to see much smaller hot spots as well, the seeds of local 
objects like clusters and superclusters of galaxies. 
   277 
   They shouldn‘t have long to wait. 73) Astrophysicists working with 
ground-based detectors at 
   the South Pole and balloon-borne instruments are closing in on such 
structures, and may report their findings soon. 
   74) If the small hot spots look as expected, that will be a triumph 
for yet another scientific idea, a refinement of the Big Bang called the 
inflationary universe theory. Inflation says that very 
   early on, the universe expanded in size by more than a trillion 
trillion trillion trillionfold in much less than a second, propelled by 
a sort of antigravity. 75) Odd though it sounds, cosmic inflation is a 
scientifically plausible consequence of some respected ideas in 
elementary particle physics, and many astrophysicists have been 
convinced for the better part of a decade that it is true.

   It was 3:45 in the morning when the vote was finally taken. After 
six months of arguing and final 16 hours of hot parliamentary debates, 
Australia‘s Northern Territory became the first legal 
   authority in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of 
incurably ill patients who wish to die. The measure passed by the 
convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word flashed on the 
Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess, 
executive director of the Right to Die Society of Canada. He sent it on 
via the group‘s on-line service, Death NET. Says Hofsess: 
   DWe posted bulletins all day long, because of course this isn‘t 
just something that happened in Australia. It‘s world history.‖ 
   The full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of the 
Terminally Ill law has left physicians and citizens alike trying to deal 
with its moral and practical implications. Some have breathed sighs of 
relief, others, including churches, right-to-life groups and the 
Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the haste 
of its passage. But the tide is unlikely to turn back. In Australia -- 
where an aging population, life-extending technology and changing 
community attitudes have all played their part -- other states are going 
to consider making a similar law to deal with euthanasia. In the US and 
Canada, where the right-to-die movement is gathering strength, observers 
are waiting for the dominoes to start falling. 
   Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request 
death -- probably by a deadly injection or pill -- to put an end to 
suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as terminally ill by two 
doctors. After a Dcooling off‖ period of seven days, the patient can 
sign a certificate of 
   request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd 
Nickson, a 54-year-old Darwin resident suffering from lung cancer, the 
NT Rights of Terminally Ill law means he can get on with living without 
the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his 
breathing condition. DI‘m not afraid of dying from a spiritual point 
of view, but what I was afraid of was how I‘d go, because I‘ve watched 
people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at 
   their masks,‖ he says.

   A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US is how 
friendly, courteous, and helpful most Americans were to them. To be fair, 
this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians, and 
should best be considered North American. There are, of course, 
exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi 
drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet it is an observation made so 
frequently that it deserves comment. 
   For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a 
traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness 
and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived 
distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources 
of diversion, and brought news of the outside world. 
   The harsh realities of the frontier also shaped this tradition of 
hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often 
had nowhere to turn except to the nearest cabin or settlement. It was 
not a matter of choice for the traveler or merely a charitable impulse 
on the part of the settlers. It reflected the harshness of daily life: 
if you didn‘t take in the stranger and 
   take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, 
remember, you might be in the same situation. 
   Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in 
helping the weary 
   291 
   traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is 
still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns 
away from the busy tourist trails. DI was just traveling through, got 
talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for 
dinner -- amazing.‖ Such 
   observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but 
are not always understood properly. The casual friendliness of many 
Americans should be interpreted neither as superficial nor as artificial, 
but as the result of a historically developed cultural tradition. 
   As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of 
cultural signals, assumptions, and conventions underlies all social 
interrelationships. And, of course, speaking a language does not 
necessarily mean that someone understands social and cultural patterns. 
Visitors who fail to Dtranslate‖ cultural meanings properly often draw 
wrong conclusions. For example, when an American uses the 
word Dfriend,‖ the cultural implications of the word may be quite 
different from those it has in the visitor‘s language and culture. It 
takes more than a brief 
   encounter on a bus to distinguish between courteous convention and 
individual interest. Yet, being friendly is a virtue that many Americans 
value highly and expect from both neighbors and strangers. 
   55. In the eyes of visitors from the outside world, ________. 
   [A] rude taxi drivers are rarely seen in the US 
   [B] small-minded officials deserve a serious comment 
   [C] Canadians are not so friendly as their neighbors 
   [D] most Americans are ready to offer help 
   56. It could be inferred from the last paragraph that ________. 
   [A] culture exercises an influence over social interrelationship 
   [B] courteous convention and individual interest are interrelated 
   [C] various virtues manifest themselves exclusively among friends 
   [D] social interrelationships equal the complex set of cultural 
conventions 57. Families in frontier settlements used to entertain 
strangers ________. 
   [A] to improve their hard life 
   [B] in view of their long-distance travel 
   [C] to add some flavor to their own daily life 
   [D] out of a charitable impulse 
   58. The tradition of hospitality to strangers ________. 
   [A] tends to be superficial and artificial 
   [B] is generally well kept up in the United States 
   [C] is always understood properly 
   [D] has something to do with the busy tourist trails

   Technically, any substance other than food that alters our bodily or 
mental functioning is a drug. Many people mistakenly believe the term 
drug refers only to some sort of medicine or an illegal chemical taken 
by drug addicts. They don‘t realize that familiar substances such as 
alcohol and tobacco are also drugs. This is why the more neutral term 
substance is now used by many physicians and psychologists. The 
phrase Dsubstance abuse‖ is often used instead of Ddrug 
   abuse‖ to make clear that substances such as alcohol and tobacco 
can be just as harmfully misused as heroin and cocaine. 
   We live in a society in which the medicinal and social use of 
substances (drugs) is pervasive: an aspirin to quiet a headache, some 
wine to be sociable, coffee to get going in the morning, a cigarette for 
the nerves. When do these socially acceptable and apparently 
constructive uses of a substance become misuses? First of all, most 
substances taken in excess will produce negative effects such as 
poisoning or intense perceptual distortions. Repeated use of a substance 
can also lead to physical addiction or substance dependence. Dependence 
is marked first by an increased tolerance, with more and more of the 
substance required to produce the desired effect, and then by the 
appearance of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when the substance is 
discontinued. 
   Drugs (substances) that affect the central nervous system and alter 
perception, mood, and behavior are known as psychoactive substances. 
Psychoactive substances are commonly grouped according to whether they 
are stimulants, depressants, or hallucinogens. Stimulants initially 
speed up or activate the central nervous system, whereas depressants 
slow it down. Hallucinogens have their primary effect on perception, 
distorting and altering it in a variety of ways including producing 
hallucinations. These are the substances often called psychedelic (from 
the Greek word meaning Dmind-manifesting‖) because they seemed to 
radically alter one‘s 
   state of consciousness. 
   59. DSubstance abuse‖ (Line 5, Paragraph 1) is preferable 
to Ddrug abuse‖ in that ________. 
   [A] substances can alter our bodily or mental functioning if 
illegally used 
   [B] Ddrug abuse‖ is only related to a limited number of drug 
takers 
   [C] alcohol and tobacco are as fatal as heroin and cocaine 
   [D] many substances other than heroin or cocaine can also be 
poisonous 
   60. The word Dpervasive‖ (Line 1, Paragraph 2) might mean ________. 
   [A] widespread 
   [B] overwhelming 
   [C] piercing 
   [D] fashionable 
   61. Physical dependence on certain substances results from ________. 
   [A] uncontrolled consumption of them over long periods of time 
   [B] exclusive use of them for social purposes 
   [C] quantitative application of them to the treatment of diseases 
   293 
   [D] careless employment of them for unpleasant symptoms 
   62. From the last paragraph we can infer that ________. 
   [A] stimulants function positively on the mind 
   [B] hallucinogens are in themselves harmful to health 
   [C] depressants are the worst type of psychoactive substances 
   [D] the three types of psychoactive substances are commonly used in 
groups Text 4 
   No company likes to be told it is contributing to the moral decline 
of a nation. DIs this what you intended to accomplish with your 
careers?‖ Senator Robert Dole asked Time Warner executives last 
week. DYou have sold your souls, but must you corrupt our nation and 
threaten our children as well?‖ At Time Warner, however, such questions 
are simply the latest manifestation of the soul-searching that has 
involved the company ever since the company was born in 1990. It‘s a 
self-examination that has, at various times, involved issues of 
responsibility, creative freedom and the corporate bottom line. 
   At the core of this debate is chairman Gerald Levin, 56, who took 
over for the late Steve Ross in 1992. On the financial front, Levin is 
under pressure to raise the stock price and reduce the company‘s 
mountainous debt, which will increase to $17.3 billion after two new 
cable deals close. He has promised to sell off some of the property and 
restructure the company, but investors are waiting impatiently. 
   The flap over rap is not making life any easier for him. Levin has 
consistently defended the company‘s rap music on the grounds of 
expression. In 1992, when Time Warner was under fire for releasing Ice-
T‘s violent rap song Cop Killer, Levin described rap as a lawful 
expression of 
   street culture, which deserves an outlet. DThe test of any 
democratic society,‖ he wrote in a Wall 
   Street Journal column, Dlies not in how well it can control 
expression but in whether it gives freedom of thought and expression the 
widest possible latitude, however disputable or irritating the results 
may sometimes be. We won‘t retreat in the face of any threats.‖ 
   Levin would not comment on the debate last week, but there were 
signs that the chairman was backing off his hard-line stand, at least to 
some extent. During the discussion of rock singing verses at last 
month‘s stockholders‘ meeting, Levin asserted that Dmusic is not the 
cause of society‘s ills‖ and even cited his son, a teacher in the 
Bronx, New York, who uses rap to 
   communicate with students. But he talked as well about 
the Dbalanced struggle‖ between creative freedom and social 
responsibility, and he announced that the company would launch a drive 
to develop standards for distribution and labeling of potentially 
objectionable music. 
   The 15-member Time Warner board is generally supportive of Levin and 
his corporate strategy. But insiders say several of them have shown 
their concerns in this matter. DSome of us have known for many, many 
years that the freedoms under the First Amendment are not totally 
unlimited,‖ says Luce. DI think it is perhaps the case that some 
people associated with the company have only recently come to realize 
this.‖ 
   63. Senator Robert Dole criticized Time Warner for ________. 
   294 
   [A] its raising of the corporate stock price 
   [B] its self-examination of soul 
   [C] its neglect of social responsibility 
   [D] its emphasis on creative freedom 
   64. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE? 
   [A] Luce is a spokesman of Time Warner. 
   [B] Gerald Levin is liable to compromise. 
   [C] Time Warner is united as one in the face of the debate. 
   [D] Steve Ross is no longer alive. 
   65. In face of the recent attacks on the company, the chairman 
________. 
   [A] stuck to a strong stand to defend freedom of expression 
   [B] softened his tone and adopted some new policy 
   [C] changed his attitude and yielded to objection 
   [D] received more support from the 15-member board 
   66. The best title for this passage could be ________. 
   [A] A Company under Fire 
   [B] A Debate on Moral Decline 
   [C] A Lawful Outlet of Street Culture 
   [D] A Form of Creative Freedom 
   Text 5 
   Much of the language used to describe monetary policy, such 
as Dsteering the economy to a soft landing‖ or Da touch on the 
brakes,‖ makes it sound like a precise science. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. The link between interest rates and inflation is 
uncertain. And there are long, variable lags before policy changes have 
any effect on the economy. Hence the analogy that likens the conduct of 
monetary policy to driving a car with a blackened windscreen, a cracked 
rear-view mirror and a faulty steering wheel. 
   Given all these disadvantages, central bankers seem to have had much 
to boast about of late. Average inflation in the big seven industrial 
economies fell to a mere 2.3% last year, close to its lowest level in 30 
years, before rising slightly to 2.5% this July. This is a long way 
below the double-digit rates which many countries experienced in the 
1970s and early 1980s. 
   It is also less than most forecasters had predicted. In late 1994 
the panel of economists which The Economist polls each month said that 
America‘s inflation rate would average 3.5% in 
   1995. In fact, it fell to 2.6% in August, and is expected to average 
only about 3% for the year as a whole. In Britain and Japan inflation is 
running half a percentage point below the rate predicted at the end of 
last year. This is no flash in the pan; over the past couple of years, 
inflation has been consistently lower than expected in Britain and 
America. 
   295 
   Economists have been particularly surprised by favorable inflation 
figures in Britain and the United States, since conventional measures 
suggest that both economies, and especially America‘s, have little 
productive slack. America‘s capacity utilization, for example, hit 
historically high levels earlier this year, and its jobless rate (5.6% 
in August) has fallen below most estimates of the natural rate of 
unemployment -- the rate below which inflation has taken off in the past. 
   Why has inflation proved so mild? The most thrilling explanation is, 
unfortunately, a little defective. Some economists argue that powerful 
structural changes in the world have upended the old economic models 
that were based upon the historical link between growth and inflation. 
67. From the passage we learn that ________. 
   [A] there is a definite relationship between inflation and interest 
rates 
   [B] economy will always follow certain models 
   [C] the economic situation is better than expected 
   [D] economists had foreseen the present economic situation 
   68. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE? 
   [A] Making monetary policies is comparable to driving a car 
   [B] An extremely low jobless rate will lead to inflation 
   [C] A high unemployment rate will result from inflation 
   [D] Interest rates have an immediate effect on the economy 
   69. The sentence DThis is no flash in the pan‖ (Line 5, Paragraph 
3) means that ________. 
   [A] the low inflation rate will last for some time 
   [B] the inflation rate will soon rise 
   [C] the inflation will disappear quickly 
   [D] there is no inflation at present 
   70. The passage shows that the author is ________ the present 
situation. 
   [A] critical of 
   [B] puzzled by

   Do animals have rights? This is how the question is usually put. It 
sounds like a useful, ground-clearing way to start. 71) Actually, it 
isn‘t, because it assumes that there is an agreed 
   account of human rights, which is something the world does not have. 
   On one view of rights, to be sure, it necessarily follows that 
animals have none. 72) Some philosophers argue that rights exist only 
within a social contract, as part of an exchange of duties and 
entitlements. Therefore, animals cannot have rights. The idea of 
punishing a tiger that kills somebody is absurd, for exactly the same 
reason, so is the idea that tigers have rights. However, this is only 
one account, and by no means an uncontested one. It denies rights not 
only to animals but also to some people -- for instance, to infants, the 
mentally incapable and future generations. In addition, it is unclear 
what force a contract can have for people who never consented to it: how 
do you reply to somebody who says DI don‘t like this contract‖? 
   The point is this: without agreement on the rights of people, 
arguing about the rights of animals is fruitless. 73) It leads the 
discussion to extremes at the outset: it invites you to think that 
animals should be treated either with the consideration humans extend to 
other humans, or with no consideration at all. This is a false choice. 
Better to start with another, more fundamental, question: is the way we 
treat animals a moral issue at all? 
   Many deny it. 74) Arguing from the view that humans are different 
from animals in every relevant respect, extremists of this kind think 
that animals lie outside the area of moral choice. 
   Any regard for the suffering of animals is seen as a mistake -- a 
sentimental displacement of feeling that should properly be directed to 
other humans. 
   This view, which holds that torturing a monkey is morally equivalent 
to chopping wood, may seem bravely Dlogical.‖ In fact it is simply 
shallow: the confused center is right to reject it. The most elementary 
form of moral reasoning -- the ethical equivalent of learning to crawl -
- is to weigh others‘ interests against one‘s own. This in turn 
requires sympathy and imagination: without which there is no capacity 
for moral thought. To see an animal in pain is enough, for most, to 
engage sympathy. 75) When that happens, it is not a mistake: it is 
mankind‘s instinct for 
   moral reasoning in action, an instinct that should be encouraged 
rather than laughed at.

   Vitamins are organic compounds necessary in small amounts in the 
diet for the normal growth and maintenance of life of animals, including 
man. 
   They do not provide energy, 41 do they construct or build any part 
of the body. They are needed for 42 foods into energy and body 
maintenance. There are thirteen or more of them, and if 43 is missing a 
deficiency disease becomes 44. 
   Vitamins are similar because they are made of the same elements -- 
usually carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and 45 nitrogen. They are different 46 
their elements are 
   arranged differently, and each vitamin 47 one or more specific 
functions in the body. 
   48 enough vitamins is essential to life, although the body has no 
nutritional use for 
   49 vitamins. Many people, 50, believe in being on the Dsafe side‖ 
and thus take extra vitamins. However, a well-balanced diet will usually 
meet all the body‘s vitamin needs.

   Tight-lipped elders used to say, DIt‘s not what you want in this 
world, but what you get.‖ 
   Psychology teaches that you do get what you want if you know what 
you want and want the right things. 
   You can make a mental blueprint of a desire as you would make a 
blueprint of a house, and each of us is continually making these 
blueprints in the general routine of everyday living. If we intend to 
have friends to dinner, we plan the menu, make a shopping list, decide 
which food to cook first, and such planning is an essential for any type 
of meal to be served. 
   Likewise, if you want to find a job, take a sheet of paper, and 
write a brief account of yourself. In making a blueprint for a job, 
begin with yourself, for when you know exactly what you have to offer, 
you can intelligently plan where to sell your services. 
   This account of yourself is actually a sketch of your working life 
and should include education, experience and references. Such an account 
is valuable. It can be referred to in filling out standard application 
blanks and is extremely helpful in personal interviews. While talking to 
you, your could-be employer is deciding whether your education, your 
experience, and other qualifications, will pay him to employ you and 
your Dwares‖ and abilities must be displayed in 
   an orderly and reasonably connected manner. 
   When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and 
desires, you have something tangible to sell. Then you are ready to hunt 
for a job. Get all the possible information about your could-be job. 
Make inquiries as to the details regarding the job and the firm. Keep 
your eyes and ears open, and use your own judgment. Spend a certain 
amount of time each day seeking the employment you wish for, and keep in 
mind: Securing a job is your job now. 51. What do the elders mean when 
they say, DIt‘s not what you want in this world, but what you 
   get.‖? 
   [A] You‘ll certainly get what you want. 
   [B] It‘s no use dreaming. 
   [C] You should be dissatisfied with what you have. 
   [D] It‘s essential to set a goal for yourself. 
   52. A blueprint made before inviting a friend to dinner is used in 
this passage as ________. 
   [A] an illustration of how to write an application for a job 
   [B] an indication of how to secure a good job 
   [C] a guideline for job description 
   [D] a principle for job evaluation 
   53. According to the passage, one must write an account of himself 
before starting to find a job 
   because ________. 
   [A] that is the first step to please the employer 
   [B] that is the requirement of the employer 
   309 
   [C] it enables him to know when to sell his services 
   [D] it forces him to become clearly aware of himself 
   54. When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities

   something ________. 
   [A] definite to offer

   With the start of BBC World Service Television, millions of viewers 
in Asia and America can now watch the Corporation‘s news coverage, as 
well as listen to it. 
   And of course in Britain listeners and viewers can tune in to two 
BBC television channels, five BBC national radio services and dozens of 
local radio stations. They are brought sport, comedy, drama, music, news 
and current affairs, education, religion, parliamentary coverage, 
children‘s programmes and films for an annual license fee of ,83 per 
household. 
   It is a remarkable record, stretching back over 70 years -- yet the 
BBC‘s future is now in 
   doubt. The Corporation will survive as a publicly-funded 
broadcasting organization, at least for the time being, but its role, 
its size and its programmes are now the subject of a nation-wide debate 
in Britain. 
   The debate was launched by the Government, which invited anyone with 
an opinion of the BBC -- including ordinary listeners and viewers -- to 
say what was good or bad about the Corporation, and even whether they 
thought it was worth keeping. The reason for its inquiry is that the 
BBC‘s royal charter runs out in 1996 and it must decide whether to keep 
the organization as it is, or to make changes. 
   Defenders of the Corporation -- of whom there are many -- are fond 
of quoting the American slogan DIf it ain‘t broke, don‘t fix it.‖ 
The BBC Dain‘t broke,‖ they say, by which they mean it is not broken 
(as distinct from the word ?broke‘, meaning having no money), so why 
bother to change it? 
   Yet the BBC will have to change, because the broadcasting world 
around it is changing. The commercial TV channels C ITV and Channel 4 -
- were required by the Thatcher Government‘s 
   Broadcasting Act to become more commercial, competing with each 
other for advertisers, and cutting costs and jobs. But it is the arrival 
of new satellite channels -- funded partly by advertising and partly by 
viewers‘ subscriptions -- which will bring about the biggest changes in 
   the long term. 
   55. The world famous BBC now faces ________. 
   [A] the problem of new coverage 
   [B] an uncertain prospect 
   [C] inquiries by the general public 
   310 
   [D] shrinkage of audience 
   56. In the passage, which of the following about the BBC is NOT 
mentioned as the key issue? 
   [A] Extension of its TV service to Far East. 
   [B] Programmes as the subject of a nation-wide debate. 
   [C] Potentials for further international cooperations. 
   [D] Its existence as a broadcasting organization. 
   57. The BBC‘s Droyal charter‖ (Line 4, Paragraph 4) stands for 
________. 
   [A] the financial support from the royal family 
   [B] the privileges granted by the Queen 
   [C] a contract with the Queen 
   [D] a unique relationship with the royal family 
   58. The foremost reason why the BBC has to readjust itself is no 
other than ________. 
   [A] the emergence of commercial TV channels 
   [B] the enforcement of Broadcasting Act by the government 
   [C] the urgent necessity to reduce costs and jobs 
   [D] the challenge of new satellite channels

   In the last half of the nineteenth century Dcapital‖ 
and Dlabour‖ were enlarging and perfecting their rival organizations 
on modern lines. Many an old firm was replaced by a limited liability 
company with a bureaucracy of salaried managers. The change met the 
technical requirements of the new age by engaging a large professional 
element and prevented the decline in efficiency that so commonly spoiled 
the fortunes of family firms in the second and third generation after 
the energetic founders. It was moreover a step away from individual 
initiative, towards collectivism and municipal and state-owned business. 
The railway companies, though still private business managed for the 
benefit of shareholders, were very unlike old family business. At the 
same time the great municipalities went into business to supply lighting, 
trams and other services to the taxpayers. 
   The growth of the limited liability company and municipal business 
had important consequences. Such large, impersonal manipulation of 
capital and industry greatly increased the numbers and importance of 
shareholders as a class, an element in national life representing 
irresponsible wealth detached from the land and the duties of the 
landowners; and almost equally detached from the responsible management 
of business. All through the nineteenth century, America, Africa, India, 
Australia and parts of Europe were being developed by British capital, 
and British shareholders were thus enriched by the world‘s movement 
towards industrialization. Towns like Bournemouth and Eastbourne sprang 
up to house large Dcomfortable‖ classes who had retired on their 
incomes, and who had no relation to the rest of the community except 
that of drawing dividends and occasionally attending a 
shareholders‘ meeting to dictate their orders to 
   311 
   the management. On the other hand Dshareholding‖ meant leisure and 
freedom which was used by many of the later Victorians for the highest 
purpose of a great civilization. 
   The Dshareholders‖ as such had no knowledge of the lives, thoughts 
or needs of the workmen employed by the company in which he held shares, 
and his influence on the relations of capital and labour was not good. 
The paid manager acting for the company was in more direct relation with 
the men and their demands, but even he had seldom that familiar personal 
knowledge of the workmen which the employer had often had under the more 
patriarchal system of the old family business now passing away. Indeed 
the mere size of operations and the numbers of workmen involved rendered 
such personal relations impossible. Fortunately, however, the increasing 
power and organization of the trade unions, at least in all skilled 
trades, enabled the workmen to meet on equal terms the managers of the 
companies who employed them. The cruel discipline of the strike and 
lockout taught the two parties to respect each other‘s strength and 
understand the value of fair negotiation. 
   59. It‘s true of the old family firms that ________. 
   [A] they were spoiled by the younger generations 
   [B] they failed for lack of individual initiative 
   [C] they lacked efficiency compared with modern companies 
   [D] they could supply adequate services to the taxpayers 
   60. The growth of limited liability companies resulted in ________. 
   [A] the separation of capital from management 
   [B] the ownership of capital by managers 
   [C] the emergence of capital and labour as two classes 
   [D] the participation of shareholders in municipal business 
   61. According to the passage, all of the following are true EXCEPT 
that ________. 
   [A] the shareholders were unaware of the needs of the workers 
   [B] the old firm owners had a better understanding of their workers 
   [C] the limited liability companies were too large to run smoothly 
   [D] the trade unions seemed to play a positive role 
   62. The author is most critical of ________. 
   [A] family film owners 
   [B] landowners 
   [C] managers 
   [D] shareholders

   What accounts for the great outburst of major inventions in early 
America -- breakthroughs such as the telegraph, the steamboat and the 
weaving machine? 
   Among the many shaping factors, I would single out the country‘s 
excellent elementary 
   schools: a labor force that welcomed the new technology; the 
practice of giving premiums to inventors; and above all the American 
genius for nonverbal, Dspatial‖ thinking about things technological. 
   Why mention the elementary schools? Because thanks to these schools 
our early mechanics, especially in the New England and Middle Atlantic 
states, were generally literate and at home in arithmetic and in some 
aspects of geometry and trigonometry. 
   Acute foreign observers related American adaptiveness and 
inventiveness to this educational advantage. As a member of a British 
commission visiting here in 1853 reported, DWith a mind prepared by 
thorough school discipline, the American boy develops rapidly into the 
skilled workman.‖ 
   A further stimulus to invention came from the Dpremium‖ system, 
which preceded our 
   patent system and for years ran parallel with it. This approach, 
originated abroad, offered inventors medals, cash prizes and other 
incentives. 
   In the United States, multitudes of premiums for new devices were 
awarded at country fairs and at the industrial fairs in major cities. 
Americans flocked to these fairs to admire the new machines and thus to 
renew their faith in the beneficence of technological advance. 
   Given this optimistic approach to technological innovation, the 
American worker took readily to that special kind of nonverbal thinking 
required in mechanical technology. As Eugene Ferguson has pointed 
out, DA technologist thinks about objects that cannot be reduced to 
unambiguous verbal descriptions: they are dealt with in his mind by a 
visual, nonverbal process... The designer and the inventor... are able 
to assemble and manipulate in their minds devices that as yet do not 
exist.‖ 
   This nonverbal Dspatial‖ thinking can be just as creative as 
painting and writing. Robert 
   Fulton once wrote, DThe mechanic should sit down among levers, 
screws, wedges, wheels, etc., like a poet among the letters of the 
alphabet, considering them as an exhibition of his thoughts, in which a 
new arrangement transmits a new idea.‖ 
   When all these shaping forces -- schools, open attitudes, the 
premium system, a genius for spatial thinking -- interacted with one 
another on the rich U.S. mainland, they produced that American 
characteristic, emulation. Today that word implies mere imitation. But 
in earlier times it meant a friendly but competitive striving for fame 
and excellence. 
   63. According to the author, the great outburst of major inventions 
in early America was in a 
   large part due to ________. 
   [A] elementary schools 
   [B] enthusiastic workers 
   [C] the attractive premium system 
   [D] a special way of thinking 
   313 
   64. It is implied that adaptiveness and inventiveness of the early 
American mechanics 
   ________. 
   [A] benefited a lot from their mathematical knowledge 
   [B] shed light on disciplined school management 
   [C] was brought about by privileged home training 
   [D] owed a lot to the technological development 
   65. A technologist can be compared to an artist because ________. 
   [A] they are both winners of awards 
   [B] they are both experts in spatial thinking 
   [C] they both abandon verbal description 
   [D] they both use various instruments 
   66. The best title for this passage might be ________. 
   [A] Inventive Mind 
   [B] Effective Schooling 
   [B] Ways of Thinking

   Rumor has it that more than 20 books on creationism/evolution are in 
the publisher‘s 
   pipelines. A few have already appeared. The goal of all will be to 
try to explain to a confused and often unenlightened citizenry that 
there are not two equally valid scientific theories for the origin and 
evolution of universe and life. Cosmology, geology, and biology have 
provided a consistent, unified, and constantly improving account of what 
happened. DScientific‖ creationism, which is being pushed by some 
for Dequal time‖ in the classrooms whenever the scientific accounts of 
   evolution are given, is based on religion, not science. Virtually 
all scientists and the majority of non-fundamentalist religious leaders 
have come to regard Dscientific‖ creationism as bad science and bad 
religion. 
   The first four chapters of Kitcher‘s book give a very brief 
introduction to evolution. At 
   appropriate places, he introduces the criticisms of the creationists 
and provides answers. In the last three chapters, he takes off his 
gloves and gives the creationists a good beating. He describes their 
programmes and tactics, and, for those unfamiliar with the ways of 
creationists, the extent of their deception and distortion may come as 
an unpleasant surprise. When their basic motivation is religious, one 
might have expected more Christian behavior. 
   Kitcher is a philosopher, and this may account, in part, for the 
clarity and effectiveness of his arguments. The non-specialist will be 
able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts of data and argument that 
support evolutionary theory. The final chapter on the creationists will 
be extremely clear to all. On the dust jacket of this fine book, Stephen 
Jay Gould says: DThis book stands for reason itself.‖ And so it does -
- and all would be well were reason the only judge in the 
   314 
   creationism/evolution debate. 
   67. DCreationism‖ in the passage refers to ________. 
   [A] evolution in its true sense as to the origin of the universe 
   [B] a notion of the creation of religion 
   [C] the scientific explanation of the earth formation 
   [D] the deceptive theory about the origin of the universe 
   68. Kitcher‘s book is intended to ________. 
   [A] recommend the views of the evolutionists 
   [B] expose the true features of creationists 
   [C] curse bitterly at this opponents 
   [D] launch a surprise attack on creationists 
   69. From the passage we can infer that ________. 
   [A] reasoning has played a decisive role in the debate 
   [B] creationists do not base their argument on reasoning 
   [C] evolutionary theory is too difficult for non-specialists 
   [D] creationism is supported by scientific findings 
   70. This passage appears to be a digest of ________. 
   [A] a book review 
   [B] a scientific paper 
   [C] a magazine feature 
   [D] a newspaper editorial

   Read the following passage carefully and then translate the 
underlined sentences into Chinese. Your translation must be written 
clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points) 
   The differences in relative growth of various areas of scientific 
research have several causes. 71) Some of these causes are completely 
reasonable results of social needs. Others are reasonable consequences 
of particular advances in science being to some extent self-accelerating. 
   Some, however, are less reasonable processes of different growth in 
which preconception of the form scientific theory ought to take, by 
persons in authority, act to alter the growth pattern of different areas. 
This is a new problem probably not yet unavoidable; but it is a 
frightening trend. 72) This trend began during the Second World War, 
when several governments came to the conclusion that the specific 
demands that a government wants to make of its scientific establishment 
cannot generally be foreseen in detail. It can be predicted, however, 
that from time 
   315 
   to time, questions will arise which will require specific scientific 
answers. It is therefore generally valuable to treat the scientific 
establishment as a resource or machine to be kept in functional order. 
73) This seems mostly effectively done by supporting a certain amount of 
research not related to immediate goals but of possible consequence in 
the future. 
   This kind of support, like all government support, requires 
decisions about the appropriate recipients of funds. Decisions based on 
utility as opposed to lack of utility are straightforward. But a 
decision among projects none of which has immediate utility is more 
difficult. The goal of the supporting agencies is the praisable one of 
supporting Dgood‖ as opposed to Dbad‖ science, but a valid 
determination is difficult to make. Generally, the idea of good science 
tends to become confused with the capacity of the field in question to 
generate an elegant theory. 74) However, the world is so made that 
elegant systems are in principle unable to deal with some of the 
world‘s more fascinating and delightful aspects. 75) New forms of 
thought as well as new 
   subjects for thought must arise in the future as they have in the 
past, giving rise to new standards of elegance.

   Sleep is divided into periods of so-called REM sleep, characterized

   Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of. 
It serves directly to assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable 
prices, thereby establishing a firm home market and so making it 
possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing 
attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living. 
By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labour, 
and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the 
costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper 
would cost four times as much, the price of your television license 
would need to be doubled and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per 
cent more. 
   And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee 
of reasonable value in the products and services you buy. Apart from the 
fact that twenty-seven Acts of Parliament govern the terms of 
advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to 
live up to the promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people 
for a little while through misleading advertising. He will not do so for 
long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the 
inferior article more than once. If you see an article consistently 
advertised, it is the surest proof I know that the article does what is 
claimed for it, and that it represents good value. 
   Advertising does more for the material benefit of the community than 
any other force I can think of. 
   There is one point I feel I ought to touch on. Recently I heard a 
well-known television personality declare that he was against 
advertising because it persuades rather than informs. He was drawing 
excessively fine distinctions. Of course advertising seeks to persuade. 
   If its message were confined merely to information -- and that in 
itself would be difficult if not impossible to achieve, for even a 
detail such as the choice of the colour of a shirt is subtly persuasive 
-- advertising would be so boring that no one would pay any attention. 
But perhaps that is what the well-known television personality wants. 
   51. By the first sentence of the passage the author means that 
________. 
   [A] he is fairly familiar with the cost of advertising 
   [B] everybody knows well that advertising is money consuming 
   [C] advertising costs money like everything else 
   [D] it is worthwhile to spend money on advertising 
   327 
   52. In the passage, which of the following is NOT included in the 
advantages of advertising? 
   [A] Securing greater fame. 
   [B] Providing more jobs. 
   [C] Enhancing living standards. 
   [D] Reducing newspaper cost. 
   53. The author deems that the well-known TV personality is ________. 
   [A] very precise in passing his judgment on advertising 
   [B] interested in nothing but the buyers‘ attention 
   [C] correct in telling the difference between persuasion and 
information 
   [D] obviously partial in his views on advertising 
   54. In the author‘s opinion, ________. 
   [A] advertising can seldom bring material benefit to man by 
providing information 
   [B] advertising informs people of new ideas rather than wins them 
over 
   [C] there is nothing wrong with advertising in persuading the buyer 
   [D] the buyer is not interested in getting information from an 
advertisement Text 2 
   There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the other 
as a process. People have generally viewed personal growth as an 
external result or product that can easily be identified and measured. 
The worker who gets a promotion, the student whose grades improve, the 
foreigner who learns a new language -- all these are examples of people 
who have measurable results to show for their efforts. 
   By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult 
to determine, since by definition it is a journey and not the specific 
signposts or landmarks along the way. The process is not the road itself, 
but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or 
courage, as they encounter new experiences and unexpected obstacles. In 
this process, the journey never really ends; there are always new ways 
to experience the world, new ideas to try, new challenges to accept. 
   In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a 
willingness to take risks, to confront the unknown, and to accept the 
possibility that they may Dfail‖ at first. How we see 
   ourselves as we try a new way of being is essential to our ability 
to grow. Do we perceive ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we 
tend to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar experiences. 
Do we think we‘re shy and indecisive? Then our sense of timidity can 
   cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and not to take a step until 
we know the ground is safe. Do we think we‘re slow to adapt to change 
or that we‘re not smart enough to cope with a new challenge? Then we 
are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all. 
   These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable and 
necessary if we are to change and grow. If we do not confront and 
overcome these internal fears and doubts, if we 
   328 
   protect ourselves too much, then we cease to grow. We become trapped 
inside a shell of our own making. 
   55. A person is generally believed to achieve personal growth when 
________. 
   [A] he has given up his smoking habit 
   [B] he has made great efforts in his work 
   [C] he is keen on leaning anything new 
   [D] he has tried to determine where he is on his journey 
   56. In the author‘s eyes, one who views personal growth as a 
process would ________. 
   [A] succeed in climbing up the social ladder 
   [B] judge his ability to grow from his own achievements 
   [C] face difficulties and take up challenges 
   [D] aim high and reach his goal each time 
   57. When the author says Da new way of being‖ (Line 2~3, Para. 3) 
he is referring to ________. 
   [A] a new approach to experiencing the world 
   [B] a new way of taking risks 
   [C] a new method of perceiving ourselves 
   [D] a new system of adaptation to change 
   58. For personal growth, the author advocates all of the following 
EXCEPT ________. 
   [A] curiosity about more chances 
   [B] promptness in self-adaptation 
   [C] open-mindedness to new experiences 
   [D] avoidance of internal fears and doubts 
   Text 3 
   In such a changing, complex society formerly simple solutions to 
informational needs become complicated. Many of life‘s problems which 
were solved by asking family members, friends or colleagues are beyond 
the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where to turn for 
expert information and how to determine which expert advice to accept 
are questions facing many people today. 
   In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since 
World War II. As families move away from their stable community, their 
friends of many years, their extended family relationships, the informal 
flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence that 
information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and 
reliable. The almost unconscious flow of information about the simplest 
aspects of living can be cut off. Thus, things 
   329 
   once learned subconsciously through the casual communications of the 
extended family must be consciously learned. 
   Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of 
information. The individual now has more information available than any 
generation, and the task of finding that one piece of information 
relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated, time-consuming 
and sometimes even overwhelming. 
   Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development 
of technologies which enable the storage and delivery of more 
information with greater speed to more locations than has ever been 
possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast 
amounts of data in machine-readable files, and to program computers to 
locate specific information. Telecommunications developments enable the 
sending of messages via television, radio, and very shortly, electronic 
mail to bombard people with multitudes of messages. Satellites have 
extended the power of communications to report events at the instant of 
occurrence. Expertise can be shared worldwide through teleconferencing, 
and problems in dispute can be settled without the participants leaving 
their homes and/or jobs to travel to a distant conference site. 
Technology has facilitated the sharing of information and the storage 
and delivery of information, thus making more information available to 
more people. 
   In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is 
of greatest importance. Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-
date information to solve the day-to-day problems, the critical problems 
of their business, social and family life, will survive and 
succeed. DKnowledge is power‖ may well be the truest saying and access 
to information may be the most critical requirement of all people. 
   59. The word Dit‖ (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably refers to 
________. 
   [A] the lack of stable communities 
   [B] the breakdown of informal information channels 
   [C] the increased mobility of families 
   [D] the growing number of people moving from place to place 
   60. The main problem people may encounter today arises from the fact 
that ________. 
   [A] they have to learn new things consciously 
   [B] they lack the confidence of securing reliable and trustworthy 
information 
   [C] they have difficulty obtaining the needed information readily 
   [D] they can hardly carry out casual communications with an extended 
family 61. From the passage we can infer that ________. 
   [A] electronic mail will soon play a dominant role in transmitting 
messages 
   [B] it will become more difficult for people to keep secrets in an 
information era 
   [C] people will spend less time holding meetings or conferences 
   [D] events will be reported on the spot mainly through satellites 
   330 
   62. We can learn from the last paragraph that ________. 
   [A] it is necessary to obtain as much knowledge as possible 
   [B] people should make the best use of the information accessible 
   [C] we should realize the importance of accumulating information 
   [D] it is of vital importance to acquire needed information 
efficiently 
   Text 4 
   Personality is to a large extent inherent -- A-type parents usually 
bring about A-type offspring. But the environment must also have a 
profound effect, since if competition is important to the parents, it is 
likely to become a major factor in the lives of their children. 
   One place where children soak up A-characteristics is school, which 
is, by its very nature, a highly competitive institution. Too many 
schools adopt the Dwin at all costs‖ moral standard and measure their 
success by sporting achievements. The current passion for making 
children compete against their classmates or against the clock produces 
a two-layer system, in which competitive A-types seem in some way better 
than their B-type fellows. Being too keen to win can have dangerous 
consequences: remember that Pheidippides, the first marathon runner, 
dropped dead seconds after saying: DRejoice, we conquer!‖ 
   By far the worst form of competition in schools is the 
disproportionate emphasis on examinations. It is a rare school that 
allows pupils to concentrate on those things they do well. The merits of 
competition by examination are somewhat questionable, but competition in 
the certain knowledge of failure is positively harmful. 
   Obviously, it is neither practical nor desirable that all A 
youngsters change into B‘s. The world needs A types, and schools have 
an important duty to try to fit a child‘s personality to his 
   possible future employment. It is top management. 
   If the preoccupation of schools with academic work was lessened, 
more time might be spent teaching children surer values. Perhaps 
selection for the caring professions, especially medicine, could be made 
less by good grades in chemistry and more by such considerations as 
sensitivity and sympathy. It is surely a mistake to choose our doctors 
exclusively from A-type stock. B‘s are 
   important and should be encouraged. 
   63. According to the passage, A-type individuals are usually 
________. 
   [A] impatient 
   [B] considerate 
   [C] aggressive 
   [D] agreeable 
   64. The author is strongly opposed to the practice of examinations 
at schools because 
   ________. 
   [A] the pressure is too great on the students 
   [B] some students are bound to fail 
   331 
   [C] failure rates are too high 
   [D] the results of exanimations are doubtful 
   65. The selection of medical professionals is currently based on 
________. 
   [A] candidates‘ sensitivity 
   [B] academic achievements 
   [C] competitive spirit 
   [D] surer values 
   66. From the passage we can draw the conclusion that ________. 
   [A] the personality of a child is well established at birth 
   [B] family influence dominates the shaping of one‘s characteristics 
   [C] the development of one‘s personality is due to multiple factors 
   [D] B-type characteristics can find no place in competitive society 
   Text 5 
   That experiences influence subsequent behaviour is evidence of an 
obvious but nevertheless remarkable activity called remembering. 
Learning could not occur without the function popularly named memory. 
Constant practice has such an effect on memory as to lead to skillful 
performance on the piano, to recitation of a poem, and even to reading 
and understanding these words. So-called intelligent behaviour demands 
memory, remembering being a primary requirement for reasoning. The 
ability to solve any problem or even to recognize that a problem exists 
depends on memory. Typically, the decision to cross a street is based on 
remembering many earlier experiences. 
   Practice (or review) tends to build and maintain memory for a task 
or for any learned material. Over a period of no practice what has been 
learned tends to be forgotten; and the adaptive consequences may not 
seem obvious. Yet, dramatic instances of sudden forgetting can be seen 
to be adaptive. In this sense, the ability to forget can be interpreted 
to have survived through a process of natural selection in animals. 
Indeed, when one‘s memory of an emotionally painful experience lead to 
serious anxiety, forgetting may produce relief. Nevertheless, an 
evolutionary interpretation might make it difficult to understand how 
the commonly gradual process of forgetting survived natural selection. 
   In thinking about the evolution of memory together with all its 
possible aspects, it is helpful to consider what would happen if 
memories failed to fade. Forgetting clearly aids orientation in time, 
since old memories weaken and the new tend to stand out, providing clues 
for inferring duration. Without forgetting, adaptive ability would 
suffer, for example, learned behaviour that might have been correct a 
decade ago may no longer be. Cases are recorded of people who (by 
ordinary standards) forgot so little that their everyday activities were 
full of confusion. Thus forgetting seems to serve that survival of the 
individual and the species. 
   Another line of thought assumes a memory storage system of limited 
capacity that provides adaptive flexibility specifically through 
forgetting. In this view, continual adjustments are made 
   332 
   between learning or memory storage (input) and forgetting (output). 
Indeed, there is evidence that the rate at which individuals forget is 
directly related to how much they have learned. Such data offer gross 
support of contemporary models of memory that assume an input-output 
balance. 
   67. From the evolutionary point of view, ________. 
   [A] forgetting for lack of practice tends to be obviously inadaptive 
   [B] if a person gets very forgetful all of a sudden he must be very 
adaptive 
   [C] the gradual process of forgetting is an indication of an 
individual‘s adaptability 
   [D] sudden forgetting may bring about adaptive consequences 
   68. According to the passage, if a person never forgot, ________. 
   [A] he would survive best 
   [B] he would have a lot of trouble 
   [C] his ability to learn would be enhanced 
   [D] the evolution of memory would stop 
   69. From the last paragraph we know that ________. 
   [A] forgetfulness is a response to learning 
   [B] the memory storage system is an exactly balanced input-output 
system 
   [C] memory is a compensation for forgetting 
   [D] the capacity of a memory storage system is limited because 
forgetting occurs 70. In this article, the author tries to interpret the 
function of ________. 
   [A] remembering 
   [B] forgetting 
   [C] adapting 
   [D] experiencing

   The standardized educational or psychological tests that are widely 
used to aid in selecting, classifying, assigning, or promoting students, 
employees, and military personnel have been the target of recent attacks 
in books, magazines, the daily press, and even in Congress. 71) The 
target is wrong, for in attacking the tests, critics divert attention 
from the fault that lies with 
   333 
   ill-informed or incompetent users. The tests themselves are merely 
tools, with characteristics that can be measured with reasonable 
precision under specified conditions. Whether the results will be 
valuable, meaningless, or even misleading depends partly upon the tool 
itself but largely upon the user. 
   All informed predictions of future performance are based upon some 
knowledge of relevant past performance: school grades, research 
productivity, sales records, or whatever is appropriate. 72) How well 
the predictions will be validated by later performance depends upon the 
amount, reliability, and appropriateness of the information used and on 
the skill and wisdom with which it is interpreted. Anyone who keeps 
careful score knows that the information available is always incomplete 
and that the predictions are always subject to error. 
   Standardized tests should be considered in this context. They 
provide a quick, objective method of getting some kinds of information 
about what a person learned, the skills he has developed, or the kind of 
person he is. The information so obtained has, qualitatively, the same 
advantages and shortcomings as other kinds of information. 73) Whether 
to use tests, other kinds of information, or both in a particular 
situation depends, therefore, upon the evidence from experience 
concerning comparative validity and upon such factors as cost and 
availability. 
   74) In general, the tests work most effectively when the qualities 
to be measured can be most precisely defined and least effectively when 
what is to be measured or predicted cannot be well defined. Properly 
used, they provide a rapid means of getting comparable information about 
many people. Sometimes they identify students whose high potential has 
not been previously recognized, but there are many things they do not do. 
75) For example, they do not compensate for gross social inequality, and 
thus do not tell how able an underprivileged youngster might have been 
had he grown up under more favorable circumstances.

   Text 1 
   The American economic system is organized around a basically 
private-enterprise, market-oriented economy in which consumers largely 
determine what shall be produced by spending their money in the 
marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private 
businessmen, striving to make profits, produce these goods and services 
in competition with other businessmen; and the profit motive, operating 
under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods and 
services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the 
demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen 
to maximize profits and the desire of individuals to maximize their 
incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how 
resources are used to produce it. 
   An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by 
which consumer demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. 
In the American economy, this mechanism is provided by a price system, a 
process in which prices rise and fall in response to relative demands of 
consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in 
short supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some 
consumers will be eliminated from the market. If, on the other hand, 
producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost, this will 
tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn 
will lower the price and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, 
price is the regulating mechanism in the American economic system. 
   The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that 
individuals are allowed to own productive resources (private property), 
and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over natural 
resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the 
American economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the 
ownership of productive resources but also certain rights, including the 
right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract 
with another private individual. 
   51. In Line 8, Paragraph 1, Dthe desire of individuals to maximize 
their incomes‖ means 
   ________. 
   [A] Americans are never satisfied with their incomes 
   [B] Americans tend to overstate their incomes 
   [C] Americans want to have their incomes increased 
   [D] Americans want to increase the purchasing power of their incomes 
   52. The first two sentences in the second paragraph tell us that 
________. 
   [A] producers can satisfy the consumers by mechanized production 
   [B] consumers can express their demands through producers 
   [C] producers decide the prices of products 
   [D] supply and demand regulate prices 
   345 
   53. According to the passage, a private-enterprise economy is 
characterized by ________. 
   [A] private property and rights concerned 
   [B] manpower and natural resources control 
   [C] ownership of productive resources 
   [D] free contracts and prices 
   54. The passage is mainly about ________. 
   [A] how American goods are produced 
   [B] how American consumers buy their goods 
   [C] how American economic system works 
   [D] how American businessmen make their profits 
   Text 2 
   One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-
issued credit card. They give their owners automatic credit in stores, 
restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country, and even abroad, 
and they make many banking services available as well. More and more of 
these credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to 
withdraw or deposit money in scattered locations, whether or not the 
local branch bank is open. For many of us the Dcashless society‖ is 
not on the horizon -- it‘s already here. 
   While computers offer these conveniences to consumers, they have 
many advantages for sellers too. Electronic cash registers can do much 
more than simply ring up sales. They can keep a wide range of records, 
including who sold what, when, and to whom. This information allows 
businessmen to keep track of their list of goods by showing which items 
are being sold and how fast they are moving. Decisions to reorder or 
return goods to suppliers can then be made. At the same time these 
computers record which hours are busiest and which employees are the 
most efficient, allowing personnel and staffing assignments to be made 
accordingly. And they also identify preferred customers for promotional 
campaigns. Computers are relied on by manufacturers for similar reasons. 
Computer-analyzed marketing reports can help to decide which products to 
emphasize now, which to develop for the future, and which to drop. 
Computers keep track of goods in stock, of raw materials on hand, and 
even of the production process itself. 
   Numerous other commercial enterprises, from theaters to magazine 
publishers, from gas and electric utilities to milk processors, bring 
better and more efficient services to consumers through the use of 
computers. 
   55. According to the passage, the credit card enables its owner to 
________. 
   [A] withdraw as much money from the bank as he wishes 
   [B] obtain more convenient services than other people do 
   [C] enjoy greater trust from the storekeeper 
   [D] cash money wherever he wishes to 
   346 
   56. From the last sentence of the first paragraph we learn that 
________. 
   [A] in the future all the Americans will use credit cards 
   [B] credit cards are mainly used in the United States today 
   [C] nowadays many Americans do not pay in cash 
   [D] it is now more convenient to use credit cards than before 
   57. The phrase Dring up sales‖ (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably 
means D________‖. 
   [A] make an order of goods 
   [B] record sales on a cash register 
   [C] call the sales manager 
   [D] keep track of the goods in stock 
   58. What is this passage mainly about? 
   [A] Approaches to the commercial use of computers. 
   [B] Conveniences brought about by computers in business. 
   [C] Significance of automation in commercial enterprises. 
   [D] Advantages of credit cards in business. 
   Text 3 
   Exceptional children are different in some significant way from 
others of the same age. For these children to develop to their full 
adult potential, their education must be adapted to those differences. 
   Although we focus on the needs of exceptional children, we find 
ourselves describing their environment as well. While the leading actor 
on the stage captures our attention, we are aware of the importance of 
the supporting players and the scenery of the play itself. Both the 
family and the society in which exceptional children live are often the 
key to their growth and development. And it is in the public schools 
that we find the full expression of society‘s understanding -- the 
   knowledge, hopes, and fears that are passed on to the next 
generation. 
   Education in any society is a mirror of that society. In that mirror 
we can see the strengths, the weaknesses, the hopes, the prejudices, and 
the central values of the culture itself. The great interest in 
exceptional children shown in public education over the past three 
decades indicates the strong feeling in our society that all citizens, 
whatever their special conditions, deserve the opportunity to fully 
develop their capabilities. 
   DAll men are created equal.‖ We‘ve heard it many times, but it 
still has important meaning 
   for education in a democratic society. Although the phrase was used 
by this country‘s founders to denote equality before the law, it has 
also been interpreted to mean equality of opportunity. That concept 
implies educational opportunity for all children -- the right of each 
child to receive help in learning to the limits of his or her capacity, 
whether that capacity be small or great. Recent court decisions have 
confirmed the right of all children -- disabled or not -- to an 
appropriate education, and have ordered that public schools take the 
necessary steps to provide that 
   347 
   education. In response, schools are modifying their programs, 
adapting instruction to children who are exceptional, to those who 
cannot profit substantially from regular programs. 59. In Paragraph 2, 
the author cites the example of the leading actor on the stage to show 
that 
   ________. 
   [A] the growth of exceptional children has much to do with their 
family and the society 
   [B] exceptional children are more influenced by their families than 
normal children are 
   [C] exceptional children are the key interest of the family and 
society 
   [D] the needs of the society weigh much heavier than the needs of 
the exceptional children 60. The reason that the exceptional children 
receive so much concern in education is that 
   ________. 
   [A] they are expected to be leaders of the society 
   [B] they might become a burden of the society 
   [C] they should fully develop their potential 
   [D] disabled children deserve special consideration 
   61. This passage mainly deals with ________. 
   [A] the differences of children in their learning capabilities 
   [B] the definition of exceptional children in modern society 
   [C] the special educational programs for exceptional children 
   [D] the necessity of adapting education to exceptional children 
   62. From this passage we learn that the educational concern for 
exceptional children ________. 
   [A] is now enjoying legal support 
   [B] disagrees with the tradition of the country 
   [C] was clearly stated by the country‘s founders 
   [D] will exert great influence over court decisions 
   Text 4 
   DI have great confidence that by the end of the decade we‘ll know 
in vast detail how cancer cells arise,‖ says microbiologist Robert 
Weinberg, an expert on cancer. DBut,‖ he cautions, Dsome people have 
the idea that once one understands the causes, the cure will rapidly 
follow. Consider Pasteur, he discovered the causes of many kinds of 
infections, but it was fifty or sixty years before cures were 
available.‖ 
   This year, 50 percent of the 910,000 people who suffer from cancer 
will survive at least five years. In the year 2000, the National Cancer 
Institute estimates, that figure will be 75 percent. For some skin 
cancers, the five-year survival rate is as high as 90 percent. But other 
survival statistics are still discouraging -- 13 percent for lung cancer, 
and 2 percent for cancer of the pancreas (胰腺). 
   348 
   With as many as 120 varieties in existence, discovering how cancer 
works is not easy. The researchers made great progress in the early 
1970s, when they discovered that oncogenes, which are cancer-causing 
genes (基因), are inactive in normal cells. Anything from cosmic rays to 
radiation to diet may activate a dormant oncogene, but how remains 
unknown. If several oncogenes are driven into action, the cell, unable 
to turn them off, becomes cancerous. 
   The exact mechanisms involved are still mysterious, but the 
likelihood that many cancers are initiated at the level of genes 
suggests that we will never prevent all cancers. DChanges are a normal 
part of the evolutionary process,‖ says oncologist William Hayward. 
Environmental factors can never be totally eliminated; as Hayward points 
out, DWe can‘t prepare a medicine 
   against cosmic rays.‖ 
   The prospects for cure, though still distant, are brighter. 
   DFirst, we need to understand how the normal cell controls itself. 
Second, we have to determine whether there are a limited number of genes 
in cells which are always responsible for at least part of the trouble. 
If we can understand how cancer works, we can counteract its action.‖ 
   63. The example of Pasteur in the passage is used to ________. 
   [A] predict that the secret of cancer will be disclosed in a decade 
   [B] indicate that the prospects for curing cancer are bright 
   [C] prove that cancer will be cured in fifty to sixty years 
   [D] warn that there is still a long way to go before cancer can be 
conquered 64. The author implies that by the year 2000, ________. 
   [A] there will be a drastic rise in the five-year survival rate of 
skin-cancer patients 
   [B] 90 percent of the skin-cancer patients today will still be 
living 
   [C] the survival statistics will be fairly even among patients with 
various cancers 
   [D] there won‘ t be a drastic increase of survival rate of all 
cancer patients 
   65. Oncogenes are cancer-causing genes ________. 
   [A] that are always in operation in a healthy person 
   [B] which remain unharmful so long as they are not activated 
   [C] that can be driven out of normal cells 
   [D] which normal cells can‘t turn off 
   66. The word Ddormant‖ in the third paragraph most probably means 
________. 
   [A] dead 
   [B] ever-present 
   [C] inactive 
   [D] potential 
   349 
   Text 5 
   Discoveries in science and technology are thought by Duntaught 
minds‖ to come in blinding 
   flashes or as the result of dramatic accidents. Sir Alexander 
Fleming did not, as legend would have it, look at the mold (霉) on a 
piece of cheese and get the idea for penicillin there and then. He 
experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years before he made 
his discovery. Inventions and innovations almost always come out of 
laborious trial and error. Innovation is like soccer; even the best 
players miss the goal and have their shots blocked much more frequently 
than they score. 
   The point is that the players who score most are the ones who take 
most shots at the goal -- and so it goes with innovation in any field of 
activity. The prime difference between innovators and others is one of 
approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work consciously on 
theirs, and they follow them through until they prove practicable or 
otherwise. What ordinary people see as fanciful abstractions, 
professional innovators see as solid possibilities. 
   DCreative thinking may mean simply the realization that there‘s no 
particular virtue in doing things the way they have always been done,‖ 
wrote Rudolph Flesch, a language authority. This accounts for our 
reaction to seemingly simple innovations like plastic garbage bags and 
suitcases on wheels that make life more convenient: DHow come nobody 
thought of that before?‖ 
   The creative approach begins with the proposition that nothing is as 
it appears. Innovators will not accept that there is only one way to do 
anything. Faced with getting from A to B, the average person will 
automatically set out on the best-known and apparently simplest route. 
The innovator will search for alternate courses, which may prove easier 
in the long run and are bound to be more interesting and challenging 
even if they lead to dead ends. 
   Highly creative individuals really do march to a different drummer. 
   67. What does the author probably mean by Duntaught mind‖ in the 
first paragraph? 
   [A] A person ignorant of the hard work involved in experimentation. 
   [B] A citizen of a society that restricts personal creativity. 
   [C] A person who has had no education. 
   [D] An individual who often comes up with new ideas by accident. 
   68. According to the author, what distinguishes innovators from non-
innovators? 
   [A] The variety of ideas they have. 
   [B] The intelligence they possess. 
   [C] The way they deal with problems. 
   [D] The way they present their findings. 
   69. The author quotes Rudolph Flesch in Paragraph 3 because ________. 
   [A] Rudolph Flesch is the best-known expert in the study of human 
creativity 
   [B] the quotation strengthens the assertion that creative 
individuals look for new ways of 
   doing things 
   350 
   [C] the reader is familiar with Rudolph Flesch‘s point of view 
   [D] the quotation adds a new idea to the information previously 
presented 70. The phrase Dmarch to a different drummer‖ (the last line 
of the passage) suggests that highly 
   creative individuals are ________. 
   [A] diligent in pursuing their goals 
   [B] reluctant to follow common ways of doing things 
   [C] devoted to the progress of society 
   [D] concerned about the advance of society

   According to the new school of scientists, technology is an 
overlooked force in expanding the horizons of scientific knowledge. (71) 
Science moves forward, they say, not so much through the insights of 
great men of genius as because of more ordinary things like improved 
techniques and tools. (72) DIn short,‖ a leader of the new school 
contends, Dthe scientific revolution, as we call it, was largely the 
improvement and invention and use of a series of instruments that 
expanded the reach of science in innumerable directions.‖ 
   (73) Over the years, tools and technology themselves as a source of 
fundamental innovation have largely been ignored by historians and 
philosophers of science. The modern school that 
   hails technology argues that such masters as Galileo, Newton, 
Maxwell, Einstein, and inventors such as Edison attached great 
importance to, and derived great benefit from, craft information and 
technological devices of different kinds that were usable in scientific 
experiments. 
   The centerpiece of the argument of a technology-yes, genius-no 
advocate was an analysis of Galileo‘s role at the start of the 
scientific revolution. The wisdom of the day was derived from Ptolemy, 
an astronomer of the second century, whose elaborate system of the sky 
put Earth at the center of all heavenly motions. (74) Galileo‘s 
greatest glory was that in 1609 he was the first 
   person to turn the newly invented telescope on the heavens to prove 
that the planets revolve around the sun rather than around the Earth. 
But the real hero of the story, according to the new 
   school of scientists, was the long evolution in the improvement of 
machinery for making eye-glasses. 
   Federal policy is necessarily involved in the technology vs. genius 
dispute. (75) Whether the Government‘s should increase the financing of 
pure science at the expense of technology or vice versa (反之) often 
depends on the issue of which is seen as the driving force.

   Text 1 
   Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at 
a critical period of life can be starved and damaged? Judging from the 
drastic experiment of Frederick II in the thirteenth century, it may be. 
Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no 
mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent. 
   All the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was 
more than lack of language here. What was missing was good mothering. 
Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the 
capacity to survive is seriously affected. 
   Today no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. 
Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often 
the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of 
the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If 
these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring 
skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird 
learns to sing and to fly rapidly at the right time, but the process is 
slow and hard once the critical stage has passed. 
   Experts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed sequence 
and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late 
in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a 
baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months he can speak 
simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a 
vocabulary of three to fifty words. At three he knows about 1,000 words 
which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from 
that of his parents in style rather than grammar. 
   Recent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to 
speak. What is special 
   359 
   about man‘s brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex 
system which enables a 
   child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the 
sound pattern Dtoy-bear.‖ And even 
   more incredible is the young brain‘s ability to pick out an order 
in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine 
and recombine the parts of a language in new ways. 
   But speech has to be induced, and this depends on interaction 
between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the 
signals in the child‘s babbling (咿呀学语), grasping and 
   smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these 
signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and 
sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child‘s non-
verbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language. 
31. The purpose of Frederick II‘s experiment was ________. 
   [A] to prove that children are born with the ability to speak 
   [B] to discover what language a child would speak without hearing 
any human speech 
   [C] to find out what role careful nursing would play in teaching a 
child to speak 
   [D] to prove that a child could be damaged without learning a 
language 32. The reason some children are backward in speaking is most 
probably that ________. 
   [A] they are incapable of learning language rapidly 
   [B] they are exposed to too much language at once 
   [C] their mothers respond inadequately to their attempts to speak 
   [D] their mothers are not intelligent enough to help them 
   33. What is exceptionally remarkable about a child is that ________. 
   [A] he is born with the capacity to speak 
   [B] he has a brain more complex than an animal‘s 
   [C] he can produce his own sentences 
   [D] he owes his speech ability to good nursing 
   34. Which of the following can NOT be inferred from the passage? 
   [A] The faculty of speech is inborn in man. 
   [B] Encouragement is anything but essential to a child in language 
learning. 
   [C] The child‘s brain is highly selective. 
   [D] Most children learn their language in definite stages. 
   35. If a child starts to speak later than others, he will in future 
________. 
   [A] have a high IQ 
   [B] be less intelligent 
   360 
   [C] be insensitive to verbal signals 
   [D] not necessarily be backward 
   Text 2 
   In general, our society is becoming one of giant enterprises 
directed by a bureaucratic (官僚
   主义的) management in which man becomes a small, well-oiled cog in 
the machinery. The oiling is done with higher wages, well-ventilated 
factories and piped music, and by psychologists and Dhuman-relations‖ 
experts; yet all this oiling does not alter the fact that man has become 
powerless, that he does not wholeheartedly participate in his work and 
that he is bored with it. In fact, the blue- and the white-collar 
workers have become economic puppets who dance to the tune of automated 
machines and bureaucratic management. 
   The worker and employee are anxious, not only because they might 
find themselves out of a job; they are anxious also because they are 
unable to acquire any real satisfaction or interest in life. They live 
and die without ever having confronted the fundamental realities of 
human existence as emotionally and intellectually independent and 
productive human beings. 
   Those higher up on the social ladder are no less anxious. Their 
lives are no less empty than those of their subordinates. They are even 
more insecure in some respects. They are in a highly competitive race. 
To be promoted or to fall behind is not a matter of salary but even more 
a matter of self-respect. When they apply for their first job, they are 
tested for intelligence as well as for the tight mixture of 
submissiveness and independence. From that moment on they are tested 
again and again -- by the psychologists, for whom testing is a big 
business, and by their superiors, who judge their behavior, sociability, 
capacity to get along, etc. This constant need to prove that one is as 
good as or better than one‘s fellow-competitor creates constant anxiety 
and 
   stress, the very causes of unhappiness and illness. 
   Am I suggesting that we should return to the preindustrial mode of 
production or to nineteenth-century Dfree enterprise‖ capitalism? 
Certainly not. Problems are never solved by 
   returning to a stage which one has already outgrown. I suggest 
transforming our social system from a bureaucratically managed 
industrialism in which maximal production and consumption are ends in 
themselves into a humanist industrialism in which man and full 
development of his potentialities -- those of love and of reason -- are 
the aims of all social arrangements. Production and consumption should 
serve only as means to this end, and should be prevented from ruling man. 
   36. By Da well-oiled cog in the machinery‖ the author intends to 
render the idea that man is 
   ________. 
   [A] a necessary part of the society though each individual‘s 
function is negligible 
   [B] working in complete harmony with the rest of the society 
   [C] an unimportant part in comparison with the rest of the society, 
though functioning 
   smoothly 
   [D] a humble component of the society, especially when working 
smoothly 
   37. The real cause of the anxiety of the workers and employees is 
that ________. 
   361 
   [A] they are likely to lose their jobs 
   [B] they have no genuine satisfaction or interest in life 
   [C] they are faced with the fundamental realities of human existence 
   [D] they are deprived of their individuality and independence 
   38. From the passage we can infer that real happiness of life 
belongs to those ________. 
   [A] who are at the bottom of the society 
   [B] who are higher up in their social status 
   [C] who prove better than their fellow-competitors 
   [D] who could keep far away from this competitive world 
   39. To solve the present social problems the author suggests that we 
should ________. 
   [A] resort to the production mode of our ancestors 
   [B] offer higher wages to the workers and employees 
   [C] enable man to fully develop his potentialities 
   [D] take the fundamental realities for granted 
   40. The author‘s attitude towards industrialism might best be 
summarized as one of ________. 
   [A] approval 
   [B] dissatisfaction 
   [C] suspicion 
   [D] tolerance 
   Text 3 
   When an invention is made, the inventor has three possible courses 
of action open to him: he can give the invention to the world by 
publishing it, keep the idea secret, or patent it. 
   A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an 
inventor and the state, by which the inventor gets a limited period of 
monopoly (垄断) and publishes full details of his invention 
   to the public after that period terminates. 
   Only in the most exceptional circumstances is the lifespan of a 
patent extended to alter this normal process of events. 
   The longest extension ever granted was to Georges Valensi; his 1939 
patent for color TV receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because 
for most of the patent‘s normal life there was 
   no colour TV to receive and thus no hope of reward for the invention. 
   Because a patent remains permanently public after it has terminated, 
the shelves of the library attached to the patent office contain details 
of literally millions of ideas that are free for anyone to use and, if 
older than half a century, sometimes even re-patent. Indeed, patent 
experts often advise anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of conducting 
a search through live patents that the one sure way of avoiding 
violation of any other inventor‘s right is to plagiarize a dead 
   362 
   patent. Likewise, because publication of an idea in any other form 
permanently invalidates further patents on that idea, it is 
traditionally safe to take ideas from other areas of print. Much modern 
technological advance is based on these presumptions of legal security. 
   Anyone closely involved in patents and inventions soon learns that 
most Dnew‖ ideas are, in fact, as old as the hills. It is their 
reduction to commercial practice, either through necessity or dedication, 
or through the availability of new technology, that makes news and money. 
The basic patent for the theory of magnetic recording dates back to 1886. 
Many of the original ideas behind television originate from the late 
19th and early 20th century. Even the Volkswagen rear engine car was 
anticipated by a 1904 patent for a cart with the horse at the rear. 41. 
The passage is mainly about ________. 
   [A] an approach to patents 
   [B] the application for patents 
   [C] the use of patents 
   [D] the access to patents 
   42. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
   [A] When a patent becomes out of effect, it can be re-patented or 
extended if necessary. 
   [B] It is necessary for an inventor to apply for a patent before he 
makes his invention 
   public. 
   [C] A patent holder must publicize the details of his invention when 
its legal period is over. 
   [D] One can get all the details of a patented invention from a 
library attached to the patent 
   office. 
   43. George Valensi‘s patent lasted until 1971 because ________. 
   [A] nobody would offer any reward for his patent prior to that time 
   [B] his patent could not be put to use for an unusually long time 
   [C] there were not enough TV stations to provide colour programmes 
   [D] the colour TV receiver was not available until that time 
   44. The word Dplagiarize‖ (Line 8, Para. 5) most probably 
means D________.‖ 
   [A] steal and use 
   [B] give reward to 
   [C] make public 
   [D] take and change 
   45. From the passage we learn that ________. 
   [A] an invention will not benefit the inventor unless it is reduced 
to commercial practice 
   [B] products are actually inventions which were made a long time ago 
   363 
   [C] it is much cheaper to buy an old patent than a new one 
   [D] patent experts often recommend patents to others by conducting a 
search through dead 
   patents

answer on the ANSWER SHEET by blackening the corresponding letter in the

   Although interior design has existed since the beginning of 
architecture, its development into a specialized field is really quite 
recent. Interior designers have become important partly because of the 
many functions that might be 46 in a single large building. 
   The importance of interior design becomes 47 when we realize how 
much time we 
   48 surrounded by four walls. Whenever we need to be indoors, we want 
our surroundings to be 49 attractive and comfortable as possible. We 
also expect 50 place to be 
   appropriate to its use. You would be 51 if the inside of your 
bedroom were suddenly 
   changed to look 52 the inside of a restaurant. And you wouldn‘t 
feel 53 in a 
   business office that has the appearance of a school. 
   It soon becomes clear that the interior designer‘s most important 
basic 54 is the 
   function of the particular 55. For example, a theater with poor 
sight lines, poor 
   sound-shaping qualities, and 56 few entries and exits will not work 
for 57 
   purpose, no matter how beautifully it might be 58. Nevertheless, for 
any kind of space, 
   the designer has to make many of the same kind of 59. He or she must 
coordinate the 
   shapes, lighting and decoration of everything from ceiling to floor. 
60 addition, the 
   designer must usually select furniture or design built-in furniture, 
according to the functions that need to be served.

   (71) The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the 
expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind; it is 
simply the mode by which all phenomena are reasoned about and given 
precise and exact explanation. There is no more difference, but there is 
just the 
   same kind of difference, between the mental operations of a man of 
science and those of an ordinary person, as there is between the 
operations and methods of a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods 
in common scales, and the operations of a chemist in performing a 
difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely graded 
weights. (72) It is not that the scales in the one case, and the balance 
in the other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner 
of working; but that the latter is a much finer apparatus and of course 
much more accurate in its measurement than the former. 
   You will understand this better, perhaps, if I give you some 
familiar examples. (73) You have all heard it repeated that men of 
science work by means of induction (归纳法) and 
   deduction, that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of 
sense, manage to extract from Nature certain natural laws, and that out 
of these, by some special skill of their own, they build up their 
theories. (74) And it is imagined by many that the operations of the 
common mind can be by no means compared with these processes, and that 
they have to be acquired by a sort of special training. To hear all 
these large words, you would think that the mind of a man of science 
must be constituted differently from that of his fellow men; but if you 
will not be frightened by terms, you will discover that you are quite 
wrong, and that all these terrible apparatus are being used by 
yourselves every day and every hour of your lives. 
   There is a well-known incident in one of Moliere‘s plays, where the 
author makes the hero express unbounded delight on being told that he 
had been talking prose (散文) during the whole 
   of his life. In the same way, I trust that you will take comfort, 
and be delighted with yourselves, on the discovery that you have been 
acting on the principles of inductive and deductive philosophy during 
the same period. (75) Probably there is not one here who has not in the 
course 
   368 
   of the day had occasion to set in motion a complex train of 
reasoning, of the very same kind, though differing in degree, as that 
which a scientific man goes through in tracing the causes of natural 
phenomena.

   Section II Reading Comprehension 
   Each of the passages below is followed by some questions. For each 
question four answers are given. Read the passages carefully and choose 
the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER 
SHEET. (30 points) 
   Text 1 
   It is all very well to blame traffic jams, the cost of petrol and 
the quick pace of modern life, but manners on the roads are becoming 
horrible. Everybody knows that the nicest men become monsters behind the 
wheel. It is very well, again, to have a tiger in the tank, but to have 
one in the driver‘s seat is another matter altogether. You might 
tolerate the odd road-hog, the rude and 
   inconsiderate driver, but nowadays the well-mannered motorist is the 
exception to the rule. Perhaps the situation calls for a DBe Kind to 
Other Drivers‖ campaign, otherwise it may get completely out of hand. 
   Road politeness is not only good manners, but good sense too. It 
takes the most cool-headed and good-tempered of drivers to resist the 
temptation to revenge when subjected to uncivilized behavior. On the 
other hand, a little politeness goes a long way towards relieving the 
tensions of motoring. A friendly nod or a wave of acknowledgement in 
response to an act of politeness helps to create an atmosphere of 
goodwill and tolerance so necessary in modern traffic conditions. But 
such acknowledgements of politeness are all too rare today. Many drivers 
nowadays don‘t even seem able to recognize politeness when they see it. 
   However, misplaced politeness can also be dangerous. Typical 
examples are the driver who brakes violently to allow a car to emerge 
from a side street at some hazard to following traffic, when a few 
seconds later the road would be clear anyway; or the man who waves a 
child across a zebra crossing into the path of oncoming vehicles that 
may be unable to stop in time. The same goes for encouraging old ladies 
to cross the road wherever and whenever they care to. It always amazes 
me that the highways are not covered with the dead bodies of these 
grannies. 
   A veteran driver, whose manners are faultless, told me it would help 
if motorists learnt to filter correctly into traffic streams one at a 
time without causing the total blockages that give rise to bad temper. 
Unfortunately, modern motorists can‘t even learn to drive, let alone 
master the 
   subtler aspects of boatmanship. Years ago the experts warned us that 
the car-ownership explosion would demand a lot more give-and-take from 
all road users. It is high time for all of us to take this message to 
heart. 
   31. According to this passage, troubles on the road are primarily 
caused by ________. 
   [A] people‘s attitude towards the road-hog 
   [B] the rhythm of modern life 
   [C] the behavior of the driver 
   376 
   [D] traffic conditions 
   32. The sentence DYou might tolerate the odd road-hog... the 
rule.‖ (Para. 1) implies that 
   ________. 
   [A] our society is unjust towards well-mannered motorists 
   [B] rude drivers can be met only occasionally 
   [C] the well-mannered motorist cannot tolerate the road-hog 
   [D] nowadays impolite drivers constitute the majority of motorists 
   33. By Dgood sense,‖ the writer means ________. 
   [A] the driver‘s ability to understand and react reasonably 
   [B] the driver‘s prompt response to difficult and severe conditions 
   [C] the driver‘s tolerance of rude or even savage behavior 
   [D] the driver‘s acknowledgement of politeness and regulations 
   34. Experts have long pointed out that in the face of car-ownership 
explosion, ________. 
   [A] road users should make more sacrifice 
   [B] drivers should be ready to yield to each other 
   [C] drivers should have more communication among themselves 
   [D] drivers will suffer great loss if they pay no respect to others 
   35. In the writer‘s opinion, ________. 
   [A] strict traffic regulations are badly needed 
   [B] drivers should apply road politeness properly 
   [C] rude drivers should be punished 
   [D] drivers should avoid traffic jams

   In the atmosphere, carbon dioxide acts rather like a one-way mirror 
-- the glass in the roof of a greenhouse which allows the sun‘s rays to 
enter but prevents the heat from escaping. 
   According to a weather expert‘s prediction, the atmosphere will be 
3? warmer in the year 
   2050 than it is today, if man continues to burn fuels at the present 
rate. If this warming up took place, the ice caps in the poles would 
begin to melt, thus raising sea level several metres and severely 
flooding coastal cities. Also, the increase in atmospheric temperature 
would lead to great changes in the climate of the northern hemisphere, 
possibly resulting in an alteration of earth‘s chief food-growing zones. 
   In the past, concern about a man-made warming of the earth has 
concentrated on the Arctic because the Antarctic is much colder and has 
a much thicker ice sheet. But the weather experts are now paying more 
attention to West Antarctic, which may be affected by only a few degrees 
   377 
   of warming: in other words, by a warming on the scale that will 
possibly take place in the next fifty years from the burning of fuels. 
   Satellite pictures show that large areas of Antarctic ice are 
already disappearing. The evidence available suggests that a warming has 
taken place. This fits the theory that carbon dioxide warms the earth. 
   However, most of the fuel is burnt in the northern hemisphere, where 
temperatures seem to be falling. Scientists conclude, therefore, that up 
to now natural influences on the weather have exceeded those caused by 
man. The question is: Which natural cause has most effect on the weather? 
   One possibility is the variable behavior of the sun. Astronomers at 
one research station have studied the hot spots and Dcold‖ spots (that 
is, the relatively less hot spots) on the sun. As the sun 
   rotates, every 27.5 days, it presents hotter or Dcolder‖ faces to 
the earth, and different aspects to different parts of the earth. This 
seems to have a considerable effect on the distribution of the earth‘s 
atmospheric pressure, and consequently on wind circulation. The sun is 
also variable over 
   a long term: its heat output goes up and down in cycles, the latest 
trend being downward. 
   Scientists are now finding mutual relations between models of solar-
weather interactions and the actual climate over many thousands of years, 
including the last Ice Age. The problem is that the models are 
predicting that the world should be entering a new Ice Age and it is not. 
One way of solving this theoretical difficulty is to assume a delay of 
thousands of years while the solar effects overcome the inertia (惯性) 
of the earth‘s climate. If this is right, the warming effect of carbon 
dioxide might thus be serving as a useful counter-balance to the sun‘s 
diminishing 
   heat. 
   36. It can be concluded that a concentration of carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere would 
   ________. 
   [A] prevent the sun‘s rays from reaching the earth‘s surface 
   [B] mean a warming up in the Arctic 
   [C] account for great changes in the climate in the northern 
hemisphere 
   [D] raise the temperature of the earth‘s surface 
   37. The article was written to explain ________. 
   [A] the greenhouse effect 
   [B] the solar effects on the earth 
   [C] the models of solar-weather interactions 
   [D] the causes affecting weather 
   38. Although the fuel consumption is greater in the northern 
hemisphere, temperatures there 
   seem to be falling. This is ________. 
   [A] mainly because the levels of carbon dioxide are rising 
   378 
   [B] possible because the ice caps in the poles are melting 
   [C] exclusively due to the effect of the inertia of the earth‘s 
climate 
   [D] partly due to variations in the output of solar energy 
   39. On the basis of their models, scientists are of the opinion that 
________. 
   [A] the climate of the world should be becoming cooler 
   [B] it will take thousands of years for the inertia of the earth‘s 
climate to take effect 
   [C] the man-made warming effect helps to increase the solar effects 
   [D] the new Ice Age will be delayed by the greenhouse effect 
   40. If the assumption about the delay of a new Ice Age is correct, 
________. 
   [A] the best way to overcome the cooling effect would be to burn 
more fuels 
   [B] ice would soon cover the northern hemisphere 
   [C] the increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could 
warm up the earth even 
   more quickly 
   [D] the greenhouse effect could work to the advantage of the earth 
   Text 3 
   Some people believe that international sport creates goodwill 
between the nations and that if countries play games together they will 
learn to live together. Others say that the opposite is true: that 
international contests encourage false national pride and lead to 
misunderstanding and hatred. There is probably some truth in both 
arguments, but in recent years the Olympic Games have done little to 
support the view that sports encourages international brotherhood. Not 
only was there the tragic incident involving the murder of athletes, but 
the Games were also ruined by lesser incidents caused principally by 
minor national contests. 
   One country received its second-place medals with visible 
indignation after the hockey (曲
   棍球) final. There had been noisy scenes at the end of the hockey 
match, the losers objecting to the final decisions. They were convinced 
that one of their goals should not have been disallowed and that their 
opponents‘ victory was unfair. Their manager was in a rage when he 
said: DThis wasn‘t hockey. Hockey and the International Hockey 
Federation are finished.‖ The president of the Federation said later 
that such behavior could result in the suspension of the team for at 
least three years. 
   The American basketball team announced that they would not yield 
first place to Russia, after a disputable end to their contest. The game 
had ended in disturbance. It was thought at first that the United States 
had won, by a single point, but it was announced that there were three 
seconds still to play. A Russian player then threw the ball from one end 
of the court to the other, and another player popped it into the basket. 
It was the first time the USA had ever lost an Olympic basketball match. 
An appeal jury debated the matter for four and a half hours before 
announcing that the result would stand. The American players then voted 
not to receive the silver medals. 
   Incidents of this kind will continue as long as sport is played 
competitively rather than for 
   379 
   the love of the game. The suggestion that athletes should compete as 
individuals, or in non-national teams, might be too much to hope for. 
But in the present organization of the Olympics there is far too much 
that encourages aggressive patriotism. 41. According to the author, 
recent Olympic Games have ________. 
   [A] created goodwill between the nations 
   [B] bred only false national pride 
   [C] barely showed any international friendship 
   [D] led to more and more misunderstanding and hatred 
   42. What did the manager mean by saying, D... Hockey and the 
International Hockey Federation 
   are finished‖? 
   [A] His team would no longer take part in international games. 
   [B] Hockey and the Federation are both ruined by the unfair 
decisions. 
   [C] There should be no more hockey matches organized by the 
Federation. 
   [D] The Federation should be dissolved. 
   43. The basketball example implied that ________. 
   [A] too much patriotism was displayed in the incident 
   [B] the announcement to prolong the match was wrong 
   [C] the appeal jury was too hesitant in making the decision 
   [D] the American team was right in rejecting the silver medals 44. 
The author gives the two examples in Paragraphs 2 and 3 to show ________. 
   [A] how false national pride led to undesirable incidents in 
international games 
   [B] that sportsmen have been more obedient than they used to be 
   [C] that competitiveness in the games discourages international 
friendship 
   [D] that unfair decisions are common in Olympic Games 
   45. What conclusion can be drawn from the passage? 
   [A] The organization of the Olympic Games must be improved. 
   [B] Athletes should compete as individual in the Olympic Games. 
   [C] Sport should be played competitively rather than for the love of 
the game. 
   [D] International contests are liable for misunderstanding between 
nations. Section III Cloze Test

   Section V English-Chinese Translation 
   Read the following passage carefully and then translate the 
underlined sentences into Chinese. (15 points) 
   DIntelligence‖ at best is an assumptive construct -- the meaning 
of the word has never been 
   clear. (71) There is more agreement on the kinds of behavior 
referred to by the term than there is on how to interpret or classify 
them. But it is generally agreed that a person of high intelligence is 
one who can grasp ideas readily, make distinctions, reason logically, 
and make use of verbal and mathematical symbols in solving problems. An 
intelligence test is a rough measure of a child‘s capacity for learning, 
particularly for learning the kinds of things required in school. It 
does not measure character, social adjustment, physical endurance, 
manual skills, or artistic abilities. It is not supposed to -- it was 
not designed for such purposes. (72) To criticize it for such failure is 
roughly comparable to criticizing a thermometer for not measuring wind 
velocity. 
   384 
   The other thing we have to notice is that the assessment of the 
intelligence of any subject is essentially a comparative affair. 
   (73) Now since the assessment of intelligence is a comparative 
matter we must be sure that the scale with which we are comparing our 
subjects provides a Dvalid‖ or Dfair‖ comparison. It is 
   here that some of the difficulties which interest us begin. Any test 
performed involves at least three factors: the intention to do one‘s 
best, the knowledge required for understanding what you have to do, and 
the intellectual ability to do it. (74) The first two must be equal for 
all who are being compared, if any comparison in terms of intelligence 
is to be made. In school populations 
   in our culture these assumptions can be made fair and reasonable, 
and the value of intelligence testing has been proved thoroughly. Its 
value lies, of course, in its providing a satisfactory basis for 
prediction. No one is in the least interested in the marks a little 
child gets on his test; what we are interested in is whether we can 
conclude from his mark on the test that the child will do better or 
worse than other children of his age at tasks which we think 
require Dgeneral 
   intelligence.‖ 
   (75) On the whole such a conclusion can be drawn with a certain 
degree of confidence, but only if the child can be assumed to have had 
the same attitude towards the test as the others with whom he is being 
compared, and only if he was not punished by lack of relevant 
information which they possessed.

   Section II Reading Comprehension 
   Each of the passages below is followed by some questions. For each 
question four answers are given. Read the passages carefully and choose 
the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER 
SHEET. (30 points) 
   Text 1 
   A wise man once said that the only thing necessary for the triumph 
of evil is for good men to do nothing. So, as a police officer, I have 
some urgent things to say to good people. 
   Day after day my men and I struggle to hold back a tidal wave of 
crime. Something has gone terribly wrong with our once-proud American 
way of life. It has happened in the area of values. A key ingredient is 
disappearing, and I think I know what it is: accountability. 
   Accountability isn‘t hard to define. It means that every person is 
responsible for his or her actions and liable for their consequences. 
   Of the many values that hold civilization together -- honesty, 
kindness, and so on -- accountability may be the most important of all. 
Without it, there can be no respect, no trust, no law -- and, ultimately, 
no society. 
   My job as a police officer is to impose accountability on people who 
refuse, or have never learned, to impose it on themselves. But as every 
policeman knows, external controls on people‘s behavior are far less 
effective than internal restraints such as guilt, shame and 
embarrassment. 
   Fortunately there are still communities -- smaller towns, usually -- 
where schools maintain discipline and where parents hold up standards 
that proclaim: DIn this family certain things are not tolerated -- they 
simply are not done!‖ 
   Yet more and more, especially in our larger cities and suburbs, 
these inner restraints are loosening. Your typical robber has none. He 
considers your property his property; he takes what he wants, including 
your life if you enrage him. 
   The main cause of this break-down is a radical shift in attitudes. 
Thirty years ago, if a crime was committed, society was considered the 
victim. Now, in a shocking reversal, it‘s the criminal 
   who is considered victimized: by his underprivileged upbringing, by 
the school that didn‘t teach him to read, by the church that failed to 
reach him with moral guidance, by the parents who didn‘t provide a 
stable home. 
   I don‘t believe it. Many others in equally disadvantaged 
circumstances choose not to engage in criminal activities. If we free 
the criminal, even partly, from accountability, we become a society of 
endless excuses where no one accepts responsibility for anything. 
   We in America desperately need more people who believe that the 
person who commits a crime is the one responsible for it. 
   31. What the wise man said suggests that ________. 
   392 
   [A] it‘s unnecessary for good people to do anything in face of evil 
   [B] it‘s certain that evil will prevail if good men do nothing 
about it 
   [C] it‘s only natural for virtue to defeat evil 
   [D] it‘s desirable for good men to keep away from evil 
   32. According to the author, if a person is found guilty of a crime, 
________. 
   [A] society is to be held responsible 
   [B] modern civilization is responsible for it 
   [C] the criminal himself should bear the blame 
   [D] the standards of living should be improved 
   33. Compared with those in small towns, people in large cities have 
________. 
   [A] less self-discipline 
   [B] better sense of discipline 
   [C] more mutual respect 
   [D] less effective government 
   34. The writer is sorry to have noticed that ________. 
   [A] people in large cities tend to excuse criminals 
   [B] people in small towns still stick to old discipline and 
standards 
   [C] today‘s society lacks sympathy for people in difficulty 
   [D] people in disadvantaged circumstances are engaged in criminal 
activities 35. The key point of the passage is that ________. 
   [A] stricter discipline should be maintained in schools and families 
   [B] more good examples should be set for people to follow 
   [C] more restrictions should be imposed on people‘s behavior 
   [D] more people should accept the value of accountability 
   Text 2 
   The period of adolescence, i.e., the period between childhood and 
adulthood, may be long or short, depending on social expectations and on 
society‘s definition as to what constitutes maturity and adulthood. In 
primitive societies adolescence is frequently a relatively short period 
of time, while in industrial societies with patterns of prolonged 
education coupled with laws against child labor, the period of 
adolescence is much longer and may include most of the second decade of 
one‘s life. Furthermore, the length of the adolescent period and the 
definition of 
   adulthood status may change in a given society as social and 
economic conditions change. Examples of this type of change are the 
disappearance of the frontier in the latter part of the nineteenth 
century in the United States, and more universally, the 
industrialization of an 
   393 
   agricultural society. 
   In modern society, ceremonies for adolescence have lost their formal 
recognition and symbolic significance and there no longer is agreement 
as to what constitutes initiation ceremonies. Social ones have been 
replaced by a sequence of steps that lead to increased recognition and 
social status. For example, grade school graduation, high school 
graduation and college graduation constitute such a sequence, and while 
each step implies certain behavioral changes and social recognition, the 
significance of each depends on the socio-economic status and the 
educational ambition of the individual. Ceremonies for adolescence have 
also been replaced by legal definitions of status roles, rights, 
privileges and responsibilities. It is during the nine years from the 
twelfth birthday to the twenty-first that the protective and restrictive 
aspects of childhood and minor status are removed and adult privileges 
and responsibilities are granted. The twelve-year-old is no longer 
considered a child and has to pay full fare for train, airplane, theater 
and movie tickets. Basically, the individual at this age loses childhood 
privileges without gaining significant adult rights. At the age of 
sixteen the adolescent is granted certain adult rights which increases 
his social status by providing him with more freedom and choices. He now 
can obtain a driver‘s license; he can leave public schools; and he can 
work without the restrictions of child labor laws. At the age of 
eighteen the law provides adult responsibilities as well as rights; the 
young man can now be a soldier, but he also can marry without parental 
permission. At the age of twenty-one the individual obtains his full 
legal rights as an adult. He now can vote, he can buy liquor, he can 
enter into financial contracts, and he is entitled to run for public 
office. No additional basic rights are acquired as a function of age 
after majority status has been attained. None of these legal provisions 
determine at what point adulthood has been reached but they do point to 
the prolonged period of adolescence. 
   36. The period of adolescence is much longer in industrial societies 
because ________. 
   [A] the definition of maturity has changed 
   [B] the industrialized society is more developed 
   [C] more education is provided and laws against child labor are made 
   [D] ceremonies for adolescence have lost their formal recognition 
and symbolic 
   significance 
   37. Former social ceremonies that used to mark adolescence have 
given place to ________. 
   [A] graduations from schools and colleges 
   [B] social recognition 
   [C] socio-economic status 
   [D] certain behavioral changes 
   38. No one can expect to fully enjoy the adulthood privileges until 
he is ________. 
   [A] eleven years old 
   [B] sixteen years old 
   [C] twenty-one years old 
   394 
   [D] between twelve and twenty-one years old 
   39. Starting from 22, ________. 
   [A] one will obtain more basic rights 
   [B] the older one becomes, the more basic rights he will have 
   [C] one won‘t get more basic rights than when he is 21 
   [D] one will enjoy more rights granted by society 
   40. According to the passage, it is true that ________. 
   [A] in the late 19th century in the United States the dividing line 
between adolescence and 
   adulthood no longer existed 
   [B] no one can marry without the permission of his parents until the 
age of twenty-one 
   [C] one is considered to have reached adulthood when he has a 
driver‘s license 
   [D] one is not free from the restrictions of child labor laws until 
he can join the army Text 3 
   Most growing plants contain much more water than all other materials 
combined. C. R. Barnes has suggested that it is as proper to term the 
plant a water structure as to call a house composed mainly of brick a 
brick building. Certain it is that all essential processes of plant 
growth and development occur in water. The mineral elements from the 
soil that are usable by the plant must be dissolved in the soil solution 
before they can be taken into the root. They are carried to all parts of 
the growing plant and are built into essential plant materials while in 
a dissolved state. The carbon dioxide (CO) from the air may enter the 
leaf as a gas but is dissolved 2
   in water in the leaf before it is combined with a part of the water 
to form simple sugars -- the base material from which the plant body is 
mainly built. Actively growing plant parts are generally 75 to 90 
percent water. Structural parts of plants, such as woody stems no longer 
actively growing, may have much less water than growing tissues. 
   The actual amount of water in the plant at any one time, however, is 
only a very small part of what passes through it during its development. 
The processes of photosynthesis, by which carbon dioxide and water are 
combined -- in the presence of chlorophyll (叶绿素) and with 
   energy derived from light -- to form sugars, require that carbon 
dioxide from the air enter the plant. This occurs mainly in the leaves. 
The leaf surface is not solid but contains great numbers of minute 
openings, through which the carbon dioxide enters. The same structure 
that permits the one gas to enter the leaf, however, permits another gas 
-- water vapor -- to be lost from it. Since carbon dioxide is present in 
the air only in trace quantities (3 to 4 parts in 10,000 parts of air) 
and water vapor is near saturation in the air spaces within the leaf (at 
80?, saturated air would 
   contain about 186 parts of water vapor in 10,000 parts of air), the 
total amount of water vapor lost is many times the carbon dioxide intake. 
Actually, because of wind and other factors, the loss of water in 
proportion to carbon dioxide intake may be even greater than the 
relative concentrations of the two gases. Also, not all of the carbon 
dioxide that enters the leaf is synthesized into carbohydrates (碳水化合
物).

   When television first began to expand, very few of the people who 
had become famous as radio commentators were able to be equally 
effective on television. Some of the difficulties they experienced when 
they were trying to 46 themselves to the new medium were technical. 
   396 
   When working 47 radio, for example, they had become 48 to seeing on 
behalf of the listener. 
   This 49 of seeing for others means that the commentator has to be 
very good at 
   talking. 50 all, he has to be able to 51 a continuous sequence of 
visual images which 52 meaning to the sounds which the listener hears. 
In the 53 of television, 
   however, the commentator sees everything with the viewer. His role, 
therefore, is 54 
   different. He is there to make 55 that the viewer does not miss some 
point of interest, to help him 56 on particular things, and to 57 the 
images on the television screen. 58 his radio colleague, he must know 
the 59 of silence and how to use it at those moments 60 the pictures

   Section V English-Chinese Translation 
   Read the following passage carefully and then translate the 
underlined sentences into Chinese. (15 points) 
   The fact is that the energy crisis, which has suddenly been 
officially announced, has been with us for a long time now, and will be 
with us for an even longer time. Whether Arab oil flows freely or not, 
it is clear to everyone that world industry cannot be allowed to depend 
on so fragile a base. (71) The supply of oil can be shut off 
unexpectedly at any time, and in any case, the oil wells will all run 
dry in thirty years or so at the present rate of use. 
   (72) New sources of energy must be found, and this will take time, 
but it is not likely to result in any situation that will ever restore 
that sense of cheap and plentiful energy we have had in the times past. 
For an indefinite period from here on, mankind is going to advance 
cautiously, and consider itself lucky that it can advance at all. 
   To make the situation worse, there is as yet no sign that any 
slowing of the world‘s population is in sight. Although the birth-rate 
has dropped in some nations, including the United States, the population 
of the world seems sure to pass six billion and perhaps even seven 
billion as the twenty-first century opens. 
   (73) The food supply will not increase nearly enough to match this, 
which means that we 
   400 
   are heading into a crisis in the matter of producing and marketing 
food. 
   Taking all this into account, what might we reasonably estimate 
supermarkets to be like in the year 2001? 
   To begin with, the world food supply is going to become steadily 
tighter over the next thirty years -- even here in the United States. By 
2001, the population of the United States will be at least two hundred 
fifty million and possibly two hundred seventy million, and the nation 
will find it difficult to expand food production to fill the additional 
mouths. (74) This will be particularly true since energy pinch will make 
it difficult to continue agriculture in the high-energy American fashion 
that makes it possible to combine few farmers with high yields. 
   It seems almost certain that by 2001 the United States will no 
longer be a great food-exporting nation and that, if necessity forces 
exports, it will be at the price of belt-tightening at home. 
   In fact, as food items will tend to decline in quality and decrease 
in variety, there is very likely to be increasing use of flavouring 
additives. (75) Until such time as mankind has the sense to lower its 
population to the point where the planet can provide a comfortable 
support for all, people will have to accept more Dunnatural food‖.

   In May 1989, space shuttle DAtlantis‖ released in outer space the 
space probe DMegallan,‖ which is now on her 15-month and one-billion-
kilometer flight to Venus. A new phase in space exploration has begun. 
   The planet Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth; it is the only 
other object in the solar system, in fact, that even comes close to 
earth‘s size. Venus has a similar density, so it is probably made of 
approximately the same stuff, and it has an atmosphere, complete with 
clouds. It is also the closest planet to earth, and thus the most 
similar in distance from the sun. In short, Venus seems to justify its 
long-held nickname of Dearth‘s twin.‖ 
   The surface temperature of Venus reaches some 900F. Added to that is 
an atmospheric pressure about 90 times Earth‘s: High overhead in the 
carbon dioxide (CO) that passes for air is 2
   a layer of clouds, perhaps 10 to 20 miles thick, whose little drops 
consist mostly of sulfuric acid (HSO). Water is all but nonexistent. 24
   Born with so many fundamental similarities to earth, how did Venus 
get to be so radically different: It is not just an academic matter. For 
all its extremes, Venus is a valuable laboratory for researchers 
studying the weather and climate of earth. It has no earth‘s oceans, so 
the heat 
   transport and other mechanisms are greatly simplified. In addition, 
the planet Venus takes 243 earth-days to turn once on its axis, so 
incoming heat from the sun is added and distributed at a more leisurely, 
observable pace. 
   16. Venus is similar to Earth in ________. 
   [A] size and density 
   [B] distance from the sun 
   [C] having atmosphere 
   [D] all of the above 
   17. The greatest value in studying Venus should be to ________. 
   [A] allow us to visit there 
   [B] understand Earth better 
   [C] find a new source of energy 
   [D] promote a new space program 
   18. The main idea of this passage is about ________. 
   [A] problems of space travel 
   [B] scientific methods in space exploration 
   [C] the importance of Venus to Earth 
   [D] conditions on Venus

   Tourists were surprised to see a woman driving a huge orange tractor 
down one of Rome‘s main avenues. Italy‘s political leaders and some of 
its male union chiefs are said to have been 
   406 
   even more puzzled to see that the tractor was followed by about 
200,000 women in a parading procession that took more than three hours 
to snake through central Rome. 
   Shouting slogans, waving flags and dancing to drumbeats, the women 
had come to the capital from all over Italy to demonstrate for Da job 
for each of us, a different type of job, and a 
   society without violence.‖ So far, action to improve women‘s 
opportunities in employment has been the province of collective 
industrial bargaining. DBut there is a growing awareness that this is 
not enough,‖ says a researcher on female labor at the government-funded 
Institute for the 
   Development of Professional Training for Workers. 
   Women, who constitute 52 per cent of Italy‘s population, today 
represent only 35 per cent of Italy‘s total workforce and 33 per cent 
of the total number of Italians with jobs. However, their presence in 
the workplace is growing. The employment of women is expanding 
considerably in services, next to the public administration and commerce 
as their principal workplace. Official statistics also show that women 
have also made significant strides in self-employment. More and more 
women are going into business for themselves. Many young women are 
turning to business because of the growing overall in employment. It is 
also a fact that today many prejudices have disappeared, so that banks 
and other financial institutes make judgments on purely business 
considerations without caring if it is a man or a woman. 
   Such changes are occurring in the professions too. The number of 
women doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers and university professors 
increased two to three fold. Some of the changes are immediately visible. 
For example, women have appeared on the scene for the first time as 
state police, railway workers and street cleaners. 
   However, the present situation is far from satisfactory though some 
progress has been made. A breakthrough in equal opportunities for women 
is now demanded. 
   19. The expression Dsnake through central Rome‖ probably 
means Dto move ________ 
   [A] quietly through central Rome.‖ 
   [B] violently through central Rome.‖ 
   [C] in a long winding line through central Rome.‖ 
   [D] at a leisurely pace through central Rome.‖ 
   20. Which of the following statements is NOT true? 
   [A] There are more women than men in Italy. 
   [B] In Italy, women are chiefly employed in services. 
   [C] In Italy, women are still at a disadvantage in employment. 
   [D] In Italy, about two-thirds of the jobs are held by men. 
   21. About 200,000 women in Rome demonstrated for ________. 
   [A] more job opportunities 
   [B] a greater variety of jobs 
   [C] Dequal job, equal pay‖ 
   407 
   [D] both A and B 
   22. The best title for this passage would be ________. 
   [A] The Role of Women is Society 
   [B] Women Demonstrate for Equality in Employment 
   [C] Women as Self-employed Professionals 
   [D] Women and the Jobs Market

   The old idea that talented children Dburn themselves out‖ in the 
early years, and, therefore, 
   are subjected to failure and at worst, mental illness is unfounded. 
As a matter of fact, the outstanding thing that happens to bright kids 
is that they are very likely to grow into bright adults. 
   To find this out, l, 500 gifted persons were followed up to their 
thirty-fifth year with these results: 
   On adult intelligence tests, they scored as high as they had as 
children. They were, as a group, in good health, physically and mentally. 
84 per cent of their group were married and seemed content with their 
lives. 
   About 70 per cent had graduated from college, though only 30 per 
cent had graduated with honors. A few had even dropped out, but nearly 
half of these had returned to graduate. Of the men, 80 per cent were in 
one of the professions or in business management or semiprofessional 
jobs. The women who had remained single had office, business, or 
professional occupations. 
   The group had published 90 books and 1,500 articles in scientific, 
scholarly, and literary magazines and had collected more than 100 
patents. 
   In a material way they did not do badly either. Average income was 
considerably higher among the gifted people, especially the men, than 
for the country as a whole, despite their comparative youth. 
   In fact, far from being strange, most of the gifted were turning 
their early promise into practical reality. 
   23. The old idea that talented children Dburn themselves out‖ in 
the early years is ________. 
   [A] true in all senses 
   [B] refuted by the author 
   [C] medically proven 
   [D] a belief of the author 
   24. The survey of bright children was made to ________. 
   [A] find out what had happened to talented children when they became 
adults 
   [B] prove that talented children Dburn themselves out‖ in the 
early years 
   [C] discover the percentage of those mentally ill among the gifted 
   408 
   [D] prove that talented children never burn themselves out 
   25. Intelligence tests showed that ________. 
   [A] bright children were unlikely to be mentally healthy 
   [B] between childhood and adulthood there was a considerable loss of 
intelligence 
   [C] talented children were most likely to become gifted adults 
   [D] when talented children grew into adults, they made low scores

   No one knows for sure what the world would be like in the year 2001. 
Many books have been written 26 the future. But the 19th-century French 
novelist Jules Verne may be called a futurologist in the fullest 27 of 
the word. In his fantastic novels DA Trip to the 
   Moon‖ and D80 Days Around the World,‖ he described with detail 
the aeroplane and even the 
   helicopter. These novels still have a great attraction 28 young 
readers of today because of 
   their bold imagination and scientific accuracy. 
   Below is a description of what our life will be in the year 2001 as 
predicted by a 29 
   writer. 
   In 2001, in the home, cookers will be set so that you can cook a 
complete meal at the touch of a switch. 
   Television will provide information on prices at the 30 shops as 
well as news and 
   entertainment. Videophones will bring pictures as well as 31 to 
telephone conversations. 
   Machines will control temperature, lighting, entertainment, security 
alarms, laundry and gardening. 
   Lighting will provide decoration as well as wallpaper. 
   At work, robots will take 32 most jobs in the manufacturing 
industries. Working 
   hours will fall to under 30 hours a week. Holidays will get longer; 
six weeks will be the normal annual holiday. Men and women will retire 
at the same age. 
   Our leisure will be different too. The home will become the center 
of entertainment through television and electronic games. More people 
will eat out in restaurants 33 they do today; 
   also they will have a much wider variety of food available. There 
will be a change of taste 
   409 
   towards a more savoury-flavored menu. New synthetic foods will form 
a 34 part of 
   people‘s diets. 
   Foreign travel will 35; winter holidays will become more popular 
than summer ones. 
   Also non-stop flights from Britain to Australia and New Zealand will 
be easily available and 
   much cheaper. Education will become increasingly more important than 
ever before.

   Section VII English-Chinese Translation 
   Read the following passage carefully and then translate the 
sentences underlined into Chinese. (20 points) 
   People have wondered for a long time how their personalities and 
behaviors are formed. It is not easy to explain why one person is 
intelligent and another is not, or why one is cooperative and another is 
competitive. 
   Social scientists are, of course, extremely interested in these 
types of questions. (61) They want to explain why we possess certain 
characteristics and exhibit certain behaviors. There are 
   no clear answers yet, but two distinct schools of thought on the 
matter have developed. As one might expect, the two approaches are very 
different from each other. The controversy is often conveniently 
referred to as Dnature vs. nurture.‖ 
   (62) Those who support the Dnature‖ side of the conflict believe 
that our personalities and 
   413 
   behavior patterns are largely determined by biological factors. (63) 
That our environment has 
   little, if anything, to do with our abilities, characteristics and 
behavior is central to this theory. 
   Taken to an extreme, this theory maintains that our behavior is pre-
determined to such a great degree that we are almost completely governed 
by our instincts. 
   Those who support the Dnurture‖ theory, that is, they advocate 
education, are often called behaviorists. They claim that our 
environment is more important than our biologically based instincts in 
determining how we will act. A behaviorist, B. F. Skinner, sees humans 
as beings whose behavior is almost completely shaped by their 
surroundings. (64) The behaviorists maintain that, like machines, humans 
respond to environmental stimuli as the basis of their behavior. 
   Let us examine the different explanations about one human 
characteristic, intelligence, offered by the two theories. (65) 
Supporters of the Dnature‖ theory insist that we are born with a 
certain capacity for learning that is biologically determined. Needless 
to say: They don‘t believe 
   that factors in the environment have much influence on what is 
basically a predetermined characteristic. On the other hand, 
behaviorists argue that our intelligence levels are the product of our 
experiences. (66) Behaviorists suggest that the child who is raised in 
an environment where there are many stimuli which develop his or her 
capacity for appropriate responses will experience greater intellectual 
development. 
   The social and political implications of these two theories are 
profound. (67) In the United States, blacks often score below whites on 
standardized intelligence tests. This leads some 
   Dnature‖ proponents to conclude that blacks are biologically 
inferior to whites. (68) Behaviorists, 
   in contrast, say that differences in scores are due to the fact that 
blacks are often deprived of many of the educational and other 
environmental advantages that whites enjoy. 
   Most people think neither of these theories can yet fully explain 
human behavior.

   Text 1 
   A scientist once said: DI have concluded that the earth is being 
visited by intelligently controlled vehicles from outer space.‖ 
   If we take this as a reasonable explanation for UFOs (unidentified 
flying objects), questions immediately come up. 
   418 
   DWhy don‘t they get in touch with us, then? Why don‘t they land 
right on the White House lawn and declare themselves?‖ people asked. 
   In reply, scientists say that, while this may be what we want, it 
may not necessarily be what they want. 
   DThe most likely explanation, it seems to me,‖ said Dr. Mead, Dis 
that they are simply watching what we are up to -- that responsible 
society outside our solar system is keeping an eye on us to see that we 
don‘t set in motion a chain reaction that might have unexpected effects 
for outside our solar system.‖ 
   Opinions from other scientists might go like this: DWhy should they 
want to get in touch with us? We may feel we‘re more important than we 
really are! They may want to observe us only and not interfere with the 
development of our civilization. They may not care if we see them but 
they also may not care to say ?hello‘.‖ 
   Some scientists have also suggested that Earth is a kind of zoo or 
wildlife reserve. Just as we set aside wilderness areas and wildlife 
reserves to allow animals and growing things to develop naturally while 
we observe them, so perhaps Earth was set aside ages ago for the same 
purpose. 
   Are we being observed by intelligent beings from other civilizations 
in the universe? Are they watching our progress in space travel? Do we 
live in a gigantic Dzoo‖ observed by our 
   Dkeepers,‖ but having no communication with them? 
   Never before in our history have we had to confront ideas like these. 
The simple fact is that we, who have always regarded ourselves as 
supreme in the universe, may not be so. Now we have to recognize that, 
among the stars in the heavens, there may very well be worlds inhabited 
by beings who are to us as we are to ants. 
   16. People who ask the question DWhy don‘t they get in touch with 
us... and declare 
   themselves?‖ think that ________. 
   [A] there are no such things as UFOs 
   [B] UFOs are visitors from solar system 
   [C] there‘s no reason for UFOs sooner or later 
   [D] we are bound to see UFOs sooner or later 
   17. According to Dr. Mead, the attitude of beings from outer space 
toward us is one of 
   ________. 
   [A] unfriendliness 
   [B] suspicion 
   [C] superiority 
   [D] hostility 
   18. The tone of the writer is that of ________. 
   [A] doubt 
   419 
   [B] warning 
   [C] indifference 
   [D] criticism

   The use of the motor is becoming more and more widespread in the 
twentieth century; as an increasing number of countries develop both 
technically and economically, so a larger proportion of the world‘s 
population is able to buy and use a car. Possessing a car gives a much 
greater degree of mobility, enabling the driver to move around freely. 
The owner of a car is no longer forced to rely on public transport and 
is, therefore, not compelled to work locally. He can choose from 
different jobs and probably changes his work more frequently as he is 
not restricted to a choice within a small radius. Travelling to work by 
car is also more comfortable than having to use public transport; the 
driver can adjust the heating in winter and the air conditioning in the 
summer to suit his own needs and preference. There is no irritation 
caused by waiting for trains, buses or underground trains, standing in 
long patient queues, or sitting on windy platforms, for as long as half 
an hour sometimes. With the building of good, fast motorways long 
distances can be covered rapidly and pleasantly. For the first time in 
this century also, many people are now able to enjoy their leisure time 
to the full by making trips to the country or seaside at the weekends, 
instead of being confined to their immediate neighbourhood. This feeling 
of independence, and the freedom to go where you please, is perhaps the 
greatest advantage of the car. 
   When considering the drawbacks, perhaps pollution is of prime 
importance. As more and more cars are produced and used, so the emission 
from their exhaust-pipes contains an ever larger volume of poisonous gas. 
Some of the contents of this gas, such as lead, not only pollute the 
atmosphere but cause actual harm to the health of people. Many of the 
minor illnesses of modern industrial society, headaches, tiredness, and 
stomach upsets are thought to arise from breathing polluted air; 
doctors‘ surgeries are full of people suffering from illnesses caused 
by 
   pollution. It is also becoming increasingly difficult to deal with 
the problem of traffic in towns; most of the important cities of the 
world suffer from traffic congestion. In fact any advantage gained in 
comfort is often cancelled out in city driving by the frustration caused 
by traffic jams: endless queues of cars crawling one after another 
through all the main streets. As an increasing number of traffic 
regulation schemes are devised, the poor bewildered driver finds himself 
diverted and forced into one-way systems which cause even greater delays 
than the traffic jams they are supposed to prevent. The mounting cost of 
petrol and the increased license fees and road tax all add to the 
driver‘s worries. In fact, he must sometimes wonder if the motor car is 
such a 
   blessing and not just a menace. 
   19. More and more people can afford to buy and use cars because 
________. 
   [A] an increasing number of cars are being produced 
   [B] the cost of cars is getting cheaper with the development of 
technology 
   [C] lots of countries have become more developed 
   [D] the use of cars has proved to be more economical 
   420 
   20. The advantages of having a car are best experienced in the 
driver‘s ________. 
   [A] freedom in choosing his job 
   [B] comfort during the travels 
   [C] enjoyment of his leisure time 
   [D] feeling of self-reliance 
   21. What is considered by the writer as the greatest menace to the 
people caused by the 
   widespread use of motor cars? 
   [A] air pollution 
   [B] traffic jams 
   [C] fatal diseases 
   [D] high cost 
   Text 3 
   Manners nowadays in metropolitan cities like London are practically 
non-existent. It is nothing for a big, strong schoolboy to elbow an 
elderly woman aside in the dash for the last remaining seat on the tube 
or bus, much less stand up and offer his seat to her, as he ought. In 
fact, it is saddening to note that if a man does offer his seat to an 
older woman, it is nearly always a Continental man or one from the older 
generation. 
   This question of giving up seats in public transport is much argued 
about by young men, who say that, since women have claimed equality, 
they no longer deserve to be treated with courtesy and that those who go 
out to work should take their turn in the rat race like anyone else. 
Women have never claimed to be physically as strong as men. Even if it 
is not agreed, however, that young men should stand up for younger women, 
the fact remains that courtesy should be shown to the old, the sick and 
the burdened. Are we really so lost to all ideals of unselfishness that 
we can sit there indifferently reading the paper or a book, saying to 
ourselves DFirst come, 
   first served,‖ while a grey-haired woman, a mother with a young 
child or a cripple stands? Yet this is all too often seen. 
   Conditions in travel are really very hard on everyone, we know, but 
hardship is surely no excuse. Sometimes one wonders what would have been 
the behaviour of these stout young men in a packed refugee train or a 
train on its way to a prison-camp during the War. Would they have 
considered it only right and their proper due to keep the best places 
for themselves then? 
   Older people, tired and irritable from a day‘s work, are not angels, 
either -- far from it. 
   Many a brisk argument or an insulting quarrel breaks out as the 
weary queues push and shove each other to get on buses and tubes. One 
cannot commend this, of course, but one does feel there is just a little 
more excuse. 
   If cities are to remain pleasant places to live in at all, however, 
it seems imperative, not only that communications in transport should be 
improved, but also that communication between human beings should be 
kept smooth and polite. All over cities, it seems that people are too 
tired and too rushed to be polite. Shop assistants won‘t bother to 
assist, taxi drivers growl at each other as they dash dangerously round 
corners, bus conductor pull the bell before their desperate 
   421 
   passengers have had time to get on or off the bus, and so on and so 
on. It seems to us that it is up to the young and strong to do their 
small part to stop such deterioration. 22. From what you have read, 
would you expect manners to improve among people ________? 
   [A] who are physically weak or crippled 
   [B] who once lived in a prison-camp during the War 
   [C] who live in big modern cities 
   [D] who live only in metropolitan cities 
   23. What is the writer‘s opinion concerning courteous manners 
towards women? 
   [A] Now that women have claimed equality, they no longer need to be 
treated differently 
   from men. 
   [B] It is generally considered old-fashioned for young men to give 
up their seats to young 
   women. 
   [C] DLady First‖ should be universally practiced. 
   [D] Special consideration ought to be shown them. 
   24. According to the author communication between human beings would 
be smoother if 
   ________. 
   [A] people were more considerate towards each other 
   [B] people were not so tired and irritable 
   [C] women were treated with more courtesy 
   [D] public transport could be improved 
   25. What is the possible meaning of the word Ddeterioration‖ in 
the last paragraph? 
   [A] worsening of general situation 
   [B] lowering of moral standards 
   [C] declining of physical constitution 
   [D] spreading of evil conduct 
   Section III Cloze Test 
   For each numbered blank in the following passage there are four 
choices labeled [A], [B], [C] and [D]. Choose the best one and put your 
choice in the ANSWER SHEET. Read the whole passage before making your 
choice. (10 points) 
   One day drought may be a thing of the past at least in coastal 
cities. Vast areas of desert throughout the world may for the first time 
26 and provide millions of hectares of land 
   where now nothing grows. 
   422 
   By the end of this century this may not be mere 27. Scientists are 
already looking 
   into the possibility of using some of the available ice in the 
Arctic and Antarctic. In these regions there are vast ice-caps formed by 
snow that has fallen over the past 50,000 years. Layer 28 layer of deep 
snow means that, when melted, the snow water would be pure, not salty as 
sea-ice would be. There is so much 29 pure water here that it would need 
only a 
   fraction of it to turn much of the desert or poorly irrigated parts 
of the world into rich farmland. And what useful packages it would come 
in! It should be possible to cut off a bit of ice and transport it! 
Alternatively perhaps a passing iceberg could be 30. They are always 
   breaking away from the main caps and floating around, pushed by 
currents, until they eventually melt and are wasted. 
   Many icebergs are, of course, far too small to be towed 31 distance, 
and would melt 
   before they reached a country that needed them anywhere. It would be 
necessary to locate one that was 32 and that was big enough to provide a 
good supply of ice when it reached us. Engineers think that an iceberg 
up to seven miles long and one and a half miles wide could be 
transported if the tug pulling it was as big as a supertanker! Even then 
they would cover only twenty miles every day. However, 33 the iceberg 
was at its destination, more that 7,000 
   million cubic metres of water could be taken from it! That would 
probably be more than enough for any medium-sized city even in the 
hottest summer! But no doubt a use could be found for it. 34, scientist 
say, there would not be too much wastage in such a journey. The larger 
the iceberg, the slower it melts, even if it is towed through the 
tropics. This is because when the sun has a bigger area to warm 35, less 
heat actually gets into the iceberg. The vast frozen 
   centre would be unaffected.

   Section VII English-Chinese Translation 
   Read the following passage carefully and then translate the 
sentences in heavy type into Chinese. (20 points) 
   When Jane Matheson started work at Advanced Electronics Inc. 12 
years ago, (61) she laboured over a microscope, hand-welding tiny 
electronic computers and turned out 18 per hour. 
   Now she tends the computerized machinery that turns out high 
capacity memory chips at the rate of 2,600 per hour. Production is up, 
profits are up, her income is up and Mrs. Matheson says the work is far 
less strain on her eyes. 
   But the most significant effect of the changes at AEI was felt by 
the workers who are no longer there. Before the new computerized 
equipment was introduced, there were 940 workers at the plant. Now there 
are 121. (62) A plant follow-up survey showed that one year after the 
layoffs only 38% of the released workers found new employment at the 
same or better wages. 
   Nearly half finally settled for lower pay and more than 13% are 
still out of work. The AEI example is only one of hundreds around the 
country which forge intelligently ahead into the latest technology, but 
leave the majority of their workers behind. 
   (63) Its beginnings obscured by unemployment caused by the world 
economic slow-down, the new technological unemployment may emerge as the 
great socio-economic challenge of the end of the 20th century. One 
corporation economist says the growth of Dmachine job 
   replacement‖ has been with us since the beginning of the industrial 
revolution, but never at the pace it is now. The human costs will be 
astonishing. (64) DIt‘s humiliating to be done out of your job by a 
machine and there is no way to fight back, but it is the effort to find 
a new job that really hurts.‖ Some workers, like Jane Matheson, are 
retrained to handle the new equipment, but often a whole new set of 
skills is required and that means a new, and invariably smaller set of 
workers. (65) The old workers, trapped by their limited skills, often 
never regain their old status and employment. Many drift into marginal 
areas. They feel no pride in their new work. They get badly paid for it 
and they feel miserable, but still they are luckier than those who never 
find it. 
   (66) The social costs go far beyond the welfare and unemployment 
payments made by the government. Unemployment increases the chances of 
divorce, child abuse, and alcoholism, a new federal survey shows. Some 
experts say the problem is only temporary... that new 
   427 
   technology will eventually create as many jobs as it destroys. (67) 
But futurologist Hymen Seymour says the astonishing efficiency of the 
new technology means there will be a simple and direct net reduction in 
the amount of human labor that needs to be done. DWe should treat this 
as 
   an opportunity to give people more leisure. It may not be easy, but 
society will have to reach a new unanimity on the division and 
distribution of labor,‖ Seymour says. He predicts most people will work 
only six-hour days and four-day weeks by the end of the century. But the 
concern of the unemployed is for now. (68) Federally funded training and 
free back-to-school programs for laid-off workers are under way, but few 
experts believe they will be able to keep up with the pace of the new 
technology. For the next few years, for a substantial portion of the 
workforce, times are going to be very tough indeed.

   Section II Reading Comprehension 
   Each of the three passages below is followed by some questions. For 
each question there are four 
   answers. Read the passages carefully and chose the best answer to 
each of the questions. Put 
   your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (20 points)

   Text 1 
   It doesn‘t come as a surprise to you to realize that it makes no 
difference what you read or study if you can‘t remember it. You just 
waste your valuable time. Maybe you have already discovered some clever 
ways to keep yourself from forgetting. 
   One dependable aid that does help you remember what you study is to 
have a specific purpose or reason for reading. You remember better what 
you read when you know why you‘re reading. 
   Why does a clerk in a store go away and leave you when your reply to 
her offer to help is, DNo, thank you. I‘m just looking‖? Both you and 
she know that if you aren‘t sure what you want, you are not likely to 
find it. But suppose you say instead, DYes, thank you. I want a pair of 
sun 
   glasses.‖ She says, DRight this way, please.‖ And you and she are 
off -- both eager to look for 
   exactly what you want. 
   It‘s quite the same with your studying. If you chose a book at 
random, Djust looking‖ for nothing in particular, you are likely to 
get just that -- nothing. But if you do know what you want, and if you 
have the right book, you are almost sure to get it. Your reasons will 
vary; they will include reading or studying Dto find out more 
about‖, Dto understand the reasons for‖, Dto find out how‖. A good 
student has a clear purpose or reason for what he is doing. 
   This is the way it works. Before you start to study, you say to 
yourself something like this, DI want to know why Stephen Vincent Benet 
happened to write about America. I‘m reading this 
   article to find out.‖ Or, DI‘m going to skim this story to see 
what life was like in medieval England.‖ Because you know why you are 
reading or studying, you relate the information to your purpose and 
remember it better. 
   Reading is not one single activity. At least two important processes 
go on at the same time. As you read, you take in ideas rapidly and 
accurately. But at the same time you express your own ideas to yourself 
as you react to what you read. You have a kind of mental conversation 
with the author. If you expressed your ideas orally, they might sound 
like this: DYes, I agree. That‘s my opinion too.‖ or DUmmmm, I 
thought that record was broken much earlier. I‘d better check those 
dates,‖ or DBut there are some other facts to be considered!‖ You 
don‘t just sit there taking in ideas -- you do something else, and that 
something else is very important. 
   This additional process of thinking about what you read includes 
evaluating it, relating it to what you already know, and using it for 
your own purposes. In other words, a good reader is a critical reader. 
One part of critical reading, as you have discovered, is distinguishing 
between facts and opinions. Facts can be checked by evidence. Opinions 
are one‘s own personal reactions. 
   Another part of critical reading is judging sources. Still another 
part is drawing accurate inferences. 
   16. If you cannot remember what you read or study, ________. 
   [A] it is no surprise 
   [B] it means you have not really learned anything

   If you live in a large city, you are quite familiar with some of the 
problems of noise, but because of some of its harmful effects, you may 
not be aware of the extent of its influence on human behavior. Although 
everyone more or less knows what noise is, i.e., it is sounds that one 
would rather not hear, it is perhaps best to define it more precisely 
for scientific purposes. One such definition is that noise is sounds 
that are unrelated to the task at hand. Thus stimuli that at one time 
might be considered relevant will at another time be considered noise, 
depending on what one is doing at the moment. In recent years there has 
been a great deal of interest in the effects of noise on human behavior, 
and concepts such as Dnoise pollution‖ have arisen, together 
   with movements to reduce noise. 
   Exposure to loud noises can definitely produce a partial or complete 
loss of hearing, depending on the intensity, duration, and frequency 
composition of the noise. Many jobs present noise hazards, such as 
working in factories and around jet aircraft, driving farm tractors, and 
working (or sitting) in music halls where rock bands are playing. In 
general, continuous exposure to sounds of over 80 decibels (a measure of 
the loudness of sound) can be considered dangerous. Decibel values 
correspond to various sounds. Sounds above about 85 decibels may, if 
exposure is for a sufficient period of time, produce significant hearing 
loss. Actual loss will depend upon the particular frequencies to which 
one is exposed, and whether the sound is continuous or intermittent. 
   Noise can have unexpected harmful effects on performance of certain 
kinds of tasks, for 
   434 
   instance, if one is performing a watch keeping task that requires 
vigilance, in which he is responsible for detecting weak signals of some 
kind (e.g., watching a radar screen for the appearance of aircraft). 
   Communicating with other people is unfavorably affected by noise. If 
you have ridden in the rear of a jet transport, you may have noticed 
that it was difficult to carry on a conversation at first, and that, 
eventually, you adjusted the loudness of your speech to compensate for 
the effect. The problem is noise. 
   20. Noise differs from sound in that ________. 
   [A] it is sounds that interfere with the task being done 
   [B] it is a special type of loud sound 
   [C] it is usually unavoidable in big cities 
   [D] it can be defined more precisely than the latter 
   21. One of the harmful effects of noise on human performance is that 
________. 
   [A] it reduces one‘s sensitivity 
   [B] it renders the victim helpless 
   [C] it deprives one of the enjoyment of music 
   [D] it drowns out conversations at worksites 
   22. The purpose of this passage is ________. 
   [A] to define the effects of noise on human behavior 
   [B] to warn people of the danger of noise pollution 
   [C] to give advice as to how to prevent hearing loss 
   [D] to tell the difference between noise and sound

   The traditional belief that a woman‘s place is in the home and that 
a woman ought not to go out to work can hardly be reasonably maintained 
in present conditions. It is said that it is a woman‘s task to care for 
the children, but families today tend to be small and with a year or two 
between children. Thus a woman‘s whole period of childbearing may occur 
within five years. Furthermore, with compulsory education from the age 
of five or six her role as chief educator of her children soon ceases. 
Thus, even if we agree that a woman should stay at home to look after 
her children before they are of school age, for many women, this period 
would extend only for about ten years. 
   It might be argued that the house-proud woman would still find 
plenty to do about the home. That may be so, but it is certainly no 
longer necessary for a woman to spend her whole life cooking, cleaning, 
mending and sewing. Washing machines take the drudgery out of laundry, 
the latest models being entirely automatic and able to wash and dry a 
large quantity of clothes in a few minutes. Refrigerators have made it 
possible to store food for long periods and many 
   435 
   pre-cooked foods are obtainable in tins. Shopping, instead of being 
a daily task, can be completed in one day a week. The new man-made 
fibers are more hardwiring than natural fibers and greatly reduce 
mending, while good ready-made clothes are cheap and plentiful. 
   Apart from women‘s own happiness, the needs of the community must 
be considered. 
   Modern society cannot do well without the contribution that women 
can make in professions and other kinds of work. There is a serious 
shortage of nurses and teachers, to mention only two of the occupations 
followed by women. It is extremely wasteful to give years of training at 
public expense only to have the qualified teacher or nurse marry after a 
year or two and be lost forever to her profession. The training, it is 
true, will help her in duties as a mother, but if she continued to work, 
her service would be more widely useful. Many factories and shops, too, 
are largely staffed by women, many of them married. While here the 
question of training is not so important, industry and trade would be 
seriously short of staff if married women did not work. 23. The author 
holds that ________. 
   [A] the right place for all women, married or otherwise, is the home, 
not elsewhere 
   [B] all married women should have some occupation outside the home 
   [C] a married woman should give first priority to her duties as a 
mother 
   [D] it is desirable for uneducated married women to stay at home and 
take care of the 
   family 
   24. A house-proud woman ________. 
   [A] would devote her whole life to her family 
   [B] would take her own happiness and that of her family as her chief 
concern 
   [C] would still need some special training at public expense to help 
her in her duties as a 
   housewife 
   [D] would take full advantage of modern household appliances 
   25. According to the author, modern society ________. 
   [A] can operate just as well even without women participation 
   [B] has been greatly hampered in its development by the shortage of 
women nurses and 
   women teachers 
   [C] cannot operate properly without the contribution of women 
   [D] will be seriously affected by the continuing shortage of working 
women in heavy 
   industries and international trade

   In 1620, a small sailboat named the Mayflower left England for the 
New World. The 
   436 
   Mayflower headed for the Jamestown colony on the warm shore of 
Virginia. Its one hundred passengers were the Pilgrims. They were 
looking for a place where they could worship God 26. Because of strong 
winds and severe storms, the Mayflower lost its 27. The 
   brave group of colonists finally had to land at Plymouth on the 
rocky coast of Massachusetts in December 1620. It was the middle of the 
stern northern winter. 28 months of starvation, 
   disease, and death were ahead of them. Only the strongest of the 
pilgrims 29 that winter. 
   Many women gave their own pitiful rations to their children and died 
for lack of food for themselves. Living 30 began to improve in the 
spring of 1621. There were wild 
   vegetables. There were berries and fruit. Fish and game were 
plentiful. Therefore, they were able to get enough fresh meat despite 
their lack of skill or experience in hunting and fishing. The 
colonists‘ health 31 with the warm weather and their better diet. 
   In the fall, they look back 32 the past year. They were both 
regretful and thankful. 
   Only fifty of the original one hundred passengers remained. The 
price in human life and tragedy had been great. On the other hand, they 
saw new hope for the future. A splendid harvest was 33 them. They were 
ready for the second winter with confidence. They had eleven crude 
houses for protection against the severe winter. Seven were for families, 
and four were for communal use. 34, they had established a treaty of 
friendship with their Indian neighbors under Chief Massasoit in the 
summer. 
   The woods and forests became safe. When the Mayflower returned to 
England that summer, 
   there were no colonists 35. At the end of their first year in their 
new home, the Pilgrims wanted to celebrate with a real holiday. It was 
their first Thanks giving Day. 26. [A] in their own style

sentences are to be translated. (20 points) 
   Seated behind the front desk at a New York firm, the receptionist 
was efficient. 
   Stylishly dressed, the firm‘s newest employee had a pleasant 
telephone voice and a natural charm that put clients at ease. The 
company was pleased: (61) Clearly, this was a person who took 
considerable pride in personal appearance. David King, the receptionist, 
is unusual, but by 
   no means unique. (62) Just as all truck drivers and construction 
workers are no longer necessarily men, all secretaries and receptionists 
are no longer automatically women. The number of men in 
   women-dominated fields is still small and they haven‘t attracted 
the attention that has often followed women advancing into male-
dominated fields, but men are moving into more and more jobs that have 
traditionally been held by women. 
   Strictly speaking, the phenomenon is not new. For the past several 
decades, men have been quietly entering fields such as nursing, social 
work and elementary education. But today no job seems off-limits. Men 
serve coffee in offices and meals on airplanes. (63) These changes are 
helping to influence some of the long-standing traditions about the 
types of work men and women can do -- but they also produce some 
undeniable problems for the men who are entering those fields formerly 
dominated by women. 
   What kinds of men venture into these so-called Dwomen‘s fields‖? 
All kinds. (64) DI don‘t 
   know of any definite answers I‘d be comfortable with,‖ explains 
Joseph Pleck, Ph.D., of the 
   Wellesley College Centre for Research on Women. 
   Sam Ormont, for example, a thirty-year-old nurse at a Boston 
hospital, went into nursing because the army had trained him as a 
medical worker. (65) DI found that work very interesting.‖ 
   he recalled, Dand when I got out of the service it just seemed 
natural for me to go into something 
   medical. I wasn‘t really interested in becoming a doctor.‖ Thirty-
five-year-old David King, an 
   out-of-work actor, found a job as a receptionist because he was 
having trouble landing roles in Broadway plays and he needed to pay the 
rent. 
   (66) In other words, men enter Dfemale‖ jobs out of the same 
consideration for personal 
   441 
   interest and economic necessity that motivates anyone looking for 
work. But similarities often 
   end there. Men in female-dominated jobs are conspicuous. As a group, 
their work histories differ in most respects from those of their female 
colleagues, and they are frequently treated differently by the people 
with whom they are in professional contact. 
   The question naturally arises: Why are there still approximately 
ninety-nine female secretaries for every one male? There is also a more 
serious issue. Most men don‘t want to be receptionists, nurses, 
secretaries or sewing workers. Put simply, these are not generally 
considered very masculine jobs. (67) To choose such a line of work is to 
invite ridicule. 
   DThere was kidding in the beginning,‖ recalls Ormont. DKids 
coming from school ask what I am, and when I say ?A nurse,‘ they laugh 
at me. I just smile and say, ?You know, there are female doctors, 
too.‘‖ 
   Still, there are encouraging signs. Years ago, male grade school 
teachers were as rare as male nurses. Today more than one elementary 
school teacher in six is male. 
   (68) Can we anticipate a day when secretaries will be an even mix of 
men and women -- or when the mention of a male nurse will no longer 
raise eyebrows? It‘s probably coming -- but not 
   very soon.

   For centuries men dreamed of achieving vertical flight. In 400 A.D. 
Chinese children played with a fan-like toy that spun upwards and fell 
back to earth as rotation ceased. Leonardo da Vinci conceive the first 
mechanical apparatus, called a DHelix,‖ which could carry man straight 
up, but was only a design and was never tested. 
   The ancient-dream was finally realized in 1940 when a Russian 
engineer piloted a strange looking craft of steel tubing with a rotating 
fan on top. It rose awkwardly and vertically into the air from a 
standing start, hovered a few feet above the ground, went sideways and 
backwards, and then settled back to earth. The vehicle was called a 
helicopter. 
   Imaginations were fired. Men dreamed of going to work in their own 
personal helicopters. People anticipate that vertical flight transports 
would carry millions of passengers as do the airliners of today. Such 
fantastic expectations were not fulfilled. 
   The helicopter has now become an extremely useful machine. It excels 
in military missions, carrying troops, guns and strategic instruments 
where other aircraft cannot go. Corporations use them as airborne 
offices, many metropolitan areas use them in police work, construction 
and logging companies employ them in various advantageous ways, 
engineers use them for site selection and surveying, and oil companies 
use them as the best way to make offshore and remote work stations 
accessible to crews and supplies. Any urgent mission to a hard-to-get-to 
place is a likely task for a helicopter. Among their other multitude of 
used: deliver people across town, fly to and from airports, assist in 
rescue work, and aid in the search for missing or wanted persons. 
   11. People expect that ________. 
   [A] the airliners of today would eventually be replaced by 
helicopters 
   [B] helicopters would someday be able to transport large number of 
people from place to 
   place as airliners are now doing 
   [C] the imaginations fired by the Russian engineer‘s invention 
would become a reality in 
   the future 
   [D] their fantastic expectations about helicopters could be 
fulfilled by airliners of today 
   12. Helicopters work with the aid of ________. 
   [A] a combination of rotating devices in front and on top 
   [B] a rotating device topside 
   [C] one rotating fan in the center of the aircraft and others at 
each end 
   [D] a rotating fan underneath for lifting 
   446 
   13. What is said about the development of the helicopter? 
   [A] Helicopters have only been worked on by man since 1940. 
   [B] Chinese children were the first to achieve flight in helicopters. 
   [C] Helicopters were considered more dangerous than the early 
airplanes. 
   [D] Some people thought they would become widely used by average 
individuals. 14. How has the use of helicopters developed? 
   [A] They have been widely used for various purposes. 
   [B] They are taking the place of high-flying jets. 
   [C] They are used for rescue work. 
   [D] They are now used exclusively for commercial projects. 
   15. Under what conditions are helicopters found to be absolutely 
essential? 
   [A] For overseas passenger transportation. 
   [B] For extremely high altitude flights. 
   [C] For high-speed transportation. 
   [D] For urgent mission to places inaccessible to other kinds of 
craft.

   In ancient Greece athletic festivals were very important and had 
strong religious associations. The Olympian athletic festival held every 
four years in honor of Zeus, king of the Olympian Gods, eventually lost 
its local character, became first a national event and then, after the 
rules against foreign competitors had been abolished, international. No 
one knows exactly how far back the Olympic Games go, but some official 
records date from 776 B.C. The games took place in August on the plain 
by Mount Olympus. Many thousands of spectators gathered from all parts 
of Greece, but no married woman was admitted even as a spectator. Slaves, 
women and dishonored persons were not allowed to compete. The exact 
sequence of events uncertain, but events included boy‘s gymnastics, 
boxing, wrestling, horse racing and field events, though there were 
fewer sports involved than in the modern Olympic Games. 
   On the last day of the Games, all the winners were honored by having 
a ring of holy olive leaves placed on their heads. So great was the 
honor that the winner of the foot race gave his name to the year of his 
victory. Although Olympic winners received no prize money, they were, in 
fact, richly rewarded by their state authorities. How their results 
compared with modern standards, we unfortunately have no means of 
telling. 
   After an uninterrupted history of almost 1,200 years, the Games were 
suspended by the Romans in 394 A.D. They continued for such a long time 
because people believed in the philosophy behind the Olympics: the idea 
that a healthy body produced a healthy mind, and that the spirit of 
competition in sports and games was preferable to the competition that 
caused wars. It was over 1,500 years before another such international 
athletic gathering took place in Athens in 1896. 
   447 
   Nowadays, the Games are held in different countries in turn. The 
host country provides vast facilities, including a stadium, swimming 
pools and living accommodation, but competing courtiers pay their own 
athletes‘ expenses. 
   The Olympics start with the arrival in the stadium of a torch, 
lighted on Mount Olympus by the sun‘s rays. It is carried by a 
succession of runners to the stadium. The torch symbolized the 
continuation of the ancient Greek athletic ideals, and it burns 
throughout the Games until the closing ceremony. The well-known Olympic 
flag, however, is a modern conception: the five interlocking rings 
symbolize the uniting of all five continents participating in the Games. 
16. In ancient Greece, the Olympic Games ________. 
   [A] were merely national athletic festivals 
   [B] were in the nature of a national event with a strong religious 
colour 
   [C] had rules which put foreign participants in a disadvantageous

in Games 
   [D] all male Greeks were qualified to compete in the Games 
   18. The order of athletic events at the ancient Olympics ________.

   [B] varied according to the number of foreign competitors 
   [C] was decided by Zeus, in whose honor the Games were held

   [A] out of the prize money of the winners 
   448 
   [B] out of the funds raised by the competing nations 
   [C] by the athletes themselves 
   [D] by contributions

   In science the meaning of the word Dexplain‖ suffers with 
civilization‘s every step in search of reality. Science cannot really 
explain electricity, magnetism, and gravitation; their effects can be 
measured and predicted, but of their nature no more is known to the 
modern scientist than to Thales who first looked into the nature of the 
electrification of amber, a hard yellowish-brown gum. Most contemporary 
physicists reject the notion that man can ever discover what these 
mysterious forces Dreally‖ are. DElectricity,‖ Bertrand Russell 
says, Dis not a thing, like St. Paul‘s Cathedral; it is a way in which 
things behave. When we have told how things behave when they are 
electrified, and under what circumstances they are electrified, we have 
told all there is to tell.‖ Until recently scientists would have 
disapproved of such an idea. Aristotle, for example, whose natural 
science dominated Western thought for two thousand years, believed that 
man could arrive at an understanding of reality by reasoning from self-
evident principles. He felt, for example, that it is a self-evident 
principle that everything in the universe has its proper place, hence 
one can deduce that objects fall to the ground because that‘s where 
they belong, and smoke goes up because that‘s where it belongs. The 
goal of Aristotelian science was to explain why things happen. Modern 
science was born when Galileo began trying to explain how things happen 
and thus originated the method of controlled experiment which now forms 
the basis of scientific investigation. 
   21. The aim of controlled scientific experiments is ________. 
   [A] to explain why things happen 
   [B] to explain how things happen 
   [C] to describe self-evident principles 
   [D] to support Aristotelian science 
   22. What principles most influenced scientific thought for two 
thousand years? 
   [A] the speculations of Thales 
   [B] the forces of electricity, magnetism, and gravity 
   [C] Aristotle‘s natural science 
   [D] Galileo‘s discoveries 
   23. Bertrand Russell‘s notion about electricity is ________. 
   [A] disapproved of by most modern scientists 
   [B] in agreement with Aristotle‘s theory of self-evident principles 
   [C] in agreement with scientific investigation directed 
toward Dhow‖ things happen 
   [D] in agreement with scientific investigation directed 
toward Dwhy‖ things happen

   24. The passage says that until recently scientists disagreed with 
the idea ________. 
   [A] that there are mysterious forces in the universe 
   [B] that man cannot discover what forces Dreally‖ are 
   [C] that there are self-evident principles 
   [D] that we can discover why things behave as they do 
   25. Modern science came into being ________. 
   [A] when the method of controlled experiment was first introduced 
   [B] when Galileo succeeded in explaining how things happen 
   [C] when Aristotelian scientist tried to explain why things happen 
   [D] when scientists were able to acquire an understanding of reality

   Cheques have 36 replaced money as a means of exchange for they are 
widely 
   accepted everywhere. Though this is very convenient for both buyer 
and seller, it should not be forgotten that cheques are not real money: 
they are quite valueless in themselves. A shop-keeper always runs a 
certain 37 when he accepts a cheques and he is quite 38 his rights 
   if on occasion, he refuses to do so. 
   People do not always know this and are shocked if their good faith 
is called 39. An 
   old and very wealthy friend of mine told me he had an extremely 
unpleasant experience. He went to a famous jewelry shop which keeps a 
large 40 of precious stones and asked to be 
   shown some pearl necklaces. After examining several trays, he 
decided to buy a particularly fine string of pearls and asked if he 
could pay by Cheques. The assistant said that this was quite 41 but the 
moment my friend signed his name, he was invited into the manager‘s 
office. 
   The manager was very polite, but he explained that someone with 
exactly the same name had presented them with a worthless Cheque not 
long ago. My friend got very angry when he heard this and said he would 
buy a necklace somewhere else. When he got up to go, the manager 
   452 
   told him that the police would arrive at any moment and he had 
better stay 42 the wanted 
   to get into serious trouble. 43, the police arrived soon afterwards. 
They apologized to my friend for the 44, but explained that a person who 
had used the same name as his was 
   responsible for a number of recent robberies. Then the police asked 
my friend to copy out a note 
   which had been used by the thief in a number of shops. The note 
45: DI have a gun in my pocket. Ask no questions and give me all the 
money in the safe.‖ Fortunately, my friend‘s 
   handwriting was quite unlike the thief‘s. He was not only allowed 
to go without further delay, 
   but to take the string of pearls with him.

   Have there always been cities? (71) Life without large urban areas 
may seem inconceivable to us, but actually cities are relatively recent 
development. Groups with primitive economics still 
   manage without them. The trend, however, is for such groups to 
disappear, while cities are increasingly becoming the dominant mode of 
man‘s social existence. (72) Historically, city life 
   has always been among the elements which form a civilization. Any 
high degree of human 
   endeavor and achievement has been closely linked to life in an urban 
environment. (73) It is virtually impossible to imagine that 
universities, hospitals, large businesses or even science and technology 
could have come into being without cities to support them. To most 
people, cities 
   have traditionally been the areas where there was a concentration of 
culture as well as of opportunity. (74) In recent years, however, people 
have begun to become aware that cities are also areas where there is a 
concentration of problems. What has happened to the modern 
   American city? Actually, the problem is not such a new one. Long 
before this century started, there had begun a trend toward the 
concentration of the poor of the American society into the cities. Each 
great wave of immigration from abroad and from the rural areas made the 
problem worse. During this century, there has also been the development 
of large suburban areas surrounding the cities, for the rich prefer to 
live in these areas. Within the cities, sections may be sharply divided 
into high and low rent districts, the Dright side of town‖ and the 
slums. 
   Of course, everyone wants to do something about this unhappy 
situation. But there is no agreement as to goals. Neither is there any 
systematic approach or integrated program. Opinions are as diverse as 
the people who give them. (75) But one basic difference of opinion 
concerns the question of whether or not the city as such is to be 
preserved. Perhaps transportation and the 
   means of communication have really made it possible for there to be 
an end to the big cities. Of course, there is the problem of persuading 
people to move out of them of their own free will. (76) And there is 
also the objection that the city has always been the core from which 
cultural advancement has radiated. Is this, however, still the case 
today in the presence of easy 
   transportation and communication? Does culture arise as a result of 
people living together communally, or is it too the result of decisions 
made at the level of government and the communications industry? 
   It is probably true to say that most people prefer to preserve the 
cities. Some think that the cities could be cleaned up or totally 
rebuilt. This is easy to say; it would not be so easy to do. (77) To be 
sure, a great rebuilding project would give jobs to many of those people 
who need them. 
   Living conditions could not help but improve, at least for a while. 
But would the problems return after the rebuilding was completed? 
   Nevertheless, with the majority of the people living in urban areas, 
the problem of the cities must be solved. (78) From agreement on this 
general goal, we have, unfortunately, in the past proceeded to 
disagreement on specific goals, and from there to total inaction. At the 
basis of 
   much of this inaction is an old-fashioned concept -- the idea human 
conditions will naturally tend to regulate themselves for the general 
goal.

   On Wednesday afternoons Annie took the bus into town to shop in the 
market. For an hour or 16 she would walk up and down between the stalls 
looking at everything, buying here and there, and 17 a sharp lookout for 
the bargains that were sometimes to be had. And 
   461 
   then, with all the things she needed 18 she would leave the market 
for the streets of the town to spend another hour 19 she liked best: 
looking in furniture shop windows. 
   One Wednesday she found a new shop full of the most delightful 
things, with a notice inviting anyone to walk in and look 20 without 
feeling they had to buy something. Annie hesitated for a moment before 
stepping through the doorway where, almost at once, she stopped 
   21 before a green armchair. There was a card on the chair which 
said: DThis fine chair is

   There are a great many careers in which the increasing emphasis is 
on specialization. You 
   463 
   find these careers in engineering, in production, in statistical 
work, and in teaching. But there is an increasing demand for people who 
are able to take in great area at a glance, people who perhaps do not 
know too much about any one field. There is, in other words, a demand 
for people who are capable of seeing the forest rather than the trees, 
of making general judgments. We can call these people Dgeneralists.‖ 
And these Dgeneralists‖ are particularly needed for positions in 
administration, where it is their job to see that other people do the 
work, where they have to plan for other people, to organize other 
people‘s work, to begin it and judge it. 
   The specialist understands one field; his concern is with technique 
and tools. He is a Dtrained‖ man; and his educational background is 
properly technical or professional. The 
   generalist -- and especially the administrator -- deals with people; 
his concern is with leadership, with planning, and with direction giving. 
He is an Deducated‖ man; and the humanities are his strongest 
foundation. Very rarely is a specialist capable of being an 
administrator. And very rarely is a good generalist also a good 
specialist in particular field. Any organization needs both kinds of 
people, though different organizations need them in different 
proportions. It is your task to find out, during your training period, 
into which of the two kinds of jobs you fit, and to plan your career 
accordingly. 
   Your first job may turn out to be the right job for you -- but this 
is pure accident. Certainly you should not change jobs constantly or 
people will become suspicious of your ability to hold any job. At the 
same time you must not look upon the first job as the final job; it is 
primarily a training job, an opportunity to understand yourself and your 
fitness for being an employee. 26. There is an increasing demand for 
________. 
   [A] all round people in their own fields 
   [B] people whose job is to organize other people‘s work 
   [C] generalists whose educational background is either technical or 
professional 
   [D] specialists whose chief concern is to provide administrative 
guidance to others 27. The specialist is ________. 
   [A] a man whose job is to train other people 
   [B] a man who has been trained in more than one fields 
   [C] a man who can see the forest rather than the trees 
   [D] a man whose concern is mainly with technical or professional 
matters 
   28. The administrator is ________. 
   [A] a Dtrained‖ man who is more a specialist than a generalist 
   [B] a man who sees the trees as well as the forest 
   [C] a man who is very strong in the humanities 
   [D] a man who is an Deducated‖ specialist 
   29. During your training period, it is important ________. 
   [A] to try to be a generalist 
   464 
   [B] to choose a profitable job 
   [C] to find an organization which fits you 
   [D] to decide whether you are fit to be a specialist or a generalist 
   30. A man‘s first job ________. 
   [A] is never the right job for him 
   [B] should not be regarded as his final job 
   [C] should not be changed or people will become suspicious of his 
ability to hold any job 
   [D] is primarily an opportunity to fit himself for his final job

   At the bottom of the world lies a mighty continent still wrapped in 
the Ice Age and, until recent times, unknown to man. It is a great land 
mass with mountain ranges whose extent and elevation are still uncertain. 
Much of the continent is a complete blank on our maps. Man has explored, 
on foot, less than one per cent of its area. Antarctica differs 
fundamentally from the Arctic regions. The Arctic is an ocean, covered 
with drifting packed ice and hemmed in by the land masses of Europe, 
Asia, and North America. The Antarctic is a continent almost as large as 
Europe and Australia combined, centered roughly on the South Pole and 
surrounded by the most unobstructed water areas of the world -- the 
Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. 
   The continental ice sheet is more than two miles high in its centre, 
thus, the air over the Antarctic is far more refrigerated than it is 
over the Arctic regions. This cold air current from the land is so 
forceful that it makes the nearby seas the stormiest in the world and 
renders unlivable those regions whose counterparts at the opposite end 
of the globe are inhabited. Thus, more than a million persons live 
within 2,000 miles of the North Pole in an area that includes most of 
Alaska, Siberia, and Scandinavia -- a region rich in forest and mining 
industries. Apart from a handful of weather stations, within the same 
distance of the South Pole there is not a single tree, industry, or 
settlement.

   Section VIII English-Chinese Translation 
   Translate the following passage into Chinese. Only the underlined 
sentences are to be translated. (20 points) 
   It would be interesting to discover how many young people go to 
university without any clear idea of what they are going to do 
afterwards. (71) If one considers the enormous variety of courses 
offered, it is not hard to see how difficult it is for a student to 
select the course most suited to his interests and abilities. (72) If a 
student goes to university to acquire a broader 
   perspective of life, to enlarge his ideas and to learn to think for 
himself, he will undoubtedly benefit. (73) Schools often have too 
restricting an atmosphere, with its time tables and disciplines, to 
allow him much time for independent assessment of the work he is asked 
to do. (74) Most 
   students would, I believe, profit by a year of such exploration of 
different academic studies, especially those Dall rounders‖ with no 
particular interest. They should have longer time to 
   decide in what subject they want to take their degrees, so that in 
later life, they do not look back and say, DI should like to have been 
an archaeologist. If I hadn‘t taken a degree in Modern 
   Languages, I shouldn‘t have ended up as an interpreter, but it‘s 
too late now. I couldn‘t go back and begin all over again.‖ 
   (75) There is, of course, another side to the question of how to 
make the best use of one‘s 
   470 
   time at university. (76) This is the case of the student who excels 
in a particular branch of learning. (77) He is immediately accepted by 
the University of his choice, and spends his three or four years 
becoming a specialist, emerging with a first-class Honour Degree and 
very little knowledge of what the rest of the world is all about. (78) 
It therefore becomes more and more 
   important that, if students are not to waste their opportunities, 
there will have to be much more detailed information about courses and 
more advice. Only in this way can we be sure that we are 
   not to have, on the one hand, a band of specialists ignorant of 
anything outside of their own subject, and on the other hand, an ever 
increasing number of graduates qualified in subjects for which there is 
little or no demand in the working world.
